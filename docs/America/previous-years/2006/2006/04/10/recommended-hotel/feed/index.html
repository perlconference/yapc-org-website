					<description>&lt;strong&gt;Call for Conferences&lt;/strong&gt;

Yes, normally it works the other way around.  A conference announces a Call for Papers/Presenters, but we're doing it the opposite way here.  If you know of a conference - preferably that you're attending - that it isn't listed, please let me know.

					<description>How would I be able to contact someone to inquire details about on-campus accomodations? I booked for 3 days and I would like to verify this is Sun. - Wed. 

Also, what about Sat. night for those who are travelling pretty far to come? Are the on-campus accomidations available, or should I look for a recommended hotel?

Thanks.</description>
