the Seventh North American<br/>

<p>
YAPC is a place for people to meet and talk about Perl -- where
people who've done interesting things, people who are working
on the language itself, people who are using it daily,
and people who are looking to learn about it are all within
arm's reach.  Some of the great authors and coders in the field
will be on hand to discuss their work, as well as the nature
and direction of Perl itself.
</p>

<p>
Please join us for three days of listening, talking and learning
about Perl in Toronto.
</p>

<ul>
<li>

Conference pre-registration will be announced in late winter to
early spring 2005.  When it opens, you can make your payment at
this link.

You might want to make a donation to The Perl Foundation as well.
You can certainly do that through this link at any time, including
now.

We are also looking for sponsors. Please contact

Abstract Submission Deadline: April 18, 2005
</b>
</div>   

<ul>

<p>
Submissions regarding all Perl topics are welcome, but they must be
technical topics aimed at the benefit of the attendees (not marketing
talks aimed at the benefit of some product or service associated with
the presenter.)
</p>

<p>
Authors will be notified if their abstract is accepted or rejected.
</p>

<p>
We're currently working on the budget for YAPC::NA 2005 and our hope
is to provide speakers at the conference with either a reduced fee or
a waived fee entirely.  Possibly there will be a combination of these
approaches built into a sliding scale based on the amount of speaking
time.
<p/>

<li> 

This year we are considering accepting a number of types of talks:

   <br><br>

<ul>

<li><b>Lightning:</b> <i>5 minutes</i>

<p>
Lightning talks are brief (5-minute) talks that focus on a single
example, idea, project, or technique.  Lightning talks do not attempt
to cover all aspects of their subject matter, but rather to present
one facet of the idea clearly and succinctly.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Information on how to submit a proposal for a lightning talk will be
posted at a later date, no later than April 2005.  We will not accept
lightning talk submissions at this time.
</b>
</p>

</li>

<li><b>Standard:</b> <i>e.g. 20 minutes</i>

<p>
A standard talk is the preferred format.  This is enough 
time to start a topic, introduce it with some pithy slides, 
and open up to later conversation. 
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Long and Extra-Long:</b> <i>e.g. 40 minutes, 85 minutes</i>

       <p>Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering
       large topics.  If you have an in-depth topic you would like
       to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable 
       discussion, a Long or Extra-Long talk may be the format of 
       choice.
</p>
</li>
<li><b>Tutorial:</b>  <i>e.g. 3 hours + break (possibly in two sets)</i>

<p>
Half-day (or possibly full-day) tutorials. These tutorials tend to
cover a wide range to material for a certain aspect of Perl
programming. For example, an XML tutorial could cover XML basics, to
writing XML, to parsing XML, to practical uses of XML.
</p>
     </li>
</ul>
   </li></ul>
Conference organizers reserve the right to change the length assigned
to a talk, if deemed neccessary. If you want to speak on multiple
topics, please submit a seperate proposal for each one.
