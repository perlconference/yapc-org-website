The overall design goal of CGI::Kwiki is /simplicity/ and /extensibility/. 

Even so, Kwiki will have some killer builtin features not available in most wikis:

* KwikiPrivacy
* KwikiSlideShow
* KwikiBlog
* KwikiSisters
* KwikiHotKeys
* KwikiFit
* KwikiPod

Each feature is implemented as a separate plugin class. This keeps things _simple_ and _extensible_.
