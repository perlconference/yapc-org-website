There are basically three levels of customization you can do with a kwiki site. They are discussed from easiest to hardest:

=== Config File Changes

=== Template/CSS Changes

There are 2 directories in your kwiki installation that contain files that control the layout and appearance of your web pages:

* [=template]
* [=css]

You can change the html and css files anyway that suits you. It is generally best to copy the modified files into [=local/template] and [=local/css]. This way your changes will not be overwritten if you later do a [=kwiki-install --upgrade].

=== Perl Code Changes
