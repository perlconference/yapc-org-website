<h3>89 Chestnut Hotel/Dorm/Conference Facility</h3>

<p>
The conference facility is  89 Chestnut street, which has both 
conference facilities and unique hotel/dorm hybrid rooms.  (See their
website -- <a href=http://89chestnut.com/>http://89chestnut.com/</a>)
These are basically hotel rooms but without a TV.  During the school
year they are used as dorm rooms for University of Toronto students,
and are used as hotel room throughout the summer months.  They are
only slightly more expensive than university dorm rooms and much less
expensive than proper hotel rooms in downtown Toronto.  This price/quality
combination plus the extreme convenience of having your room in the same
building as the conference leads us to believe that almost everyone
will opt for this option.

<p>
For people interested in proper hotels or dorms we will try to provide
other options, per the below.

<h3>Hotel</h3>
<p>

An official hotel has not been selected at this time. An announcement
will be made as soon as one is chosen.  owever, there are an unlimited
(~ 25,000) number of hotel rooms of all prices (USD$40-USD$200/night)
within easy walking distance. A "recommended" hotel nearby the
conference will be identified and negotiated with for group rates
closer to the date of the conference with some already in mind.

</p>

<a name="dorms"></a>
<h3>Dorms</h3>

<p>
Excellent dorm facilities are available from many different colleges
within the University of Toronto.  We are currently negotiating with
several to find the best one for YAPC use.  Any dorm location that is
chosen will be of good quality, very inexpensive (approximately
US$40/night/person) and very nearby the on-campus site of the
conference.
</p>

<!--<p>You can make your reservation and payment at the <a href="https://donate.perlfoundation.org/index.pl?node=dorm+info">perl foundation site</a>.-->

<p>
<b>Rates:</b>
<ul>
<li>
At 89 Chestnut, the rates for conference attendees will be approximately
C$80/night.  Several additional fees will apply, though... hotel taxes of
approx. C$10, daily parking will be approx. C$23/day if you bring a car,
optional DSL
modem rental of approx. C$5/day, and a "breakfast upgrade" of approx.
C$6/per breakfast will move you from the complimentary continental 
breakfast to a full hot breakfast.  Nevertheless, this is still very 
cheap for downtown Toronto.  And the quality of all of this is quite
high.
</li>
</ul>
