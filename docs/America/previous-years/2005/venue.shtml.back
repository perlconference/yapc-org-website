	<b>Palm Beach International Airport</b><br>
	Located between Southern Blvd. and Belvedere Rd. just off of I-95. Here is an <a href="http://www.pbia.org/location.htm">map</a>. It is roughly 20-30 minutes drive to FAU. There is a <a href="http://www.pbia.org/airlines.htm">directory online</a> airlines. They include Delta, American, Continental, Southwest, and others.

	<b>Ft. Lauderdale Airport (FLL)</b><br>
	<a href="http://www.broward.org/fll.htm">FLL airport</a> is located in Ft. Lauderdale. It is located about 25 miles south of FAU (20-30 minute drive). The drive time is roughly the same as Palm Beach International, and it is also close to I595 and I95 for driving, and has Tri Rail shuttle service to use Tri Rail.

There is a Tri Rail shuttle bus which will pick up and drop off from the airport (Palm Beach, FLL, and MIA airports). Info is on the <a href="http://www.tri-rail.com">website</a>.

	<h3>Networking</h3>

	Information on wireless networking will be coming.
	<p>
	The primary channel for FRS communications at YAPC is 5/13.  If for some reason that doesn't work,
           switch to 6/16.  If you're new to the FRS/GMRS world, freeside recommends the Garmin Rino 120 or the
           Motorola Talkabout 6250.

	There are many many things to do in the area. You can find a list of some things on the <a href="http://www.pbcgov.com/PubInf/Tourism/index.htm">Palm Beach Gov't website</a>. Of course, there is the beaches for swimming, snorkeling, boating, parasailing, fishing, people watching, SCUBA diving and tanning. There are also fun places like the <a href="http://www.morikami.org/">Morikami Museum & Japanese Gardens</a> and the <a href="http://www.palmbeachzoo.org">Palm Beach Zoo</a>. There is surely an activity, museum, restaurant and place for nightlife for everyone of every age. I highly recommend one of my favorite (and my daughters) places, <a href="http://www.lioncountrysafari.com/">Lion Country Safari</a> (maybe a group trip could be done?).
        <p>
	Between the things to do in <a href="http://www.broward.org/">Broward County</a> and <a href="http://www.pbcgov.com/">Palm Beach County</a>, everyone in the family will keep busy! Also, Disney is only 3.5-4 hours away, Key Largo is about 2 hours away, and the Everglades are minutes away. The Bahamas are a short cruise away, there are night cruises to nowhere (a.k.a. gambling cruises) from FLL and Palm Beach (<a href="http://www.pbcasino.com/">Palm Beach Princess</a>).
