Video Manipulation With Perl                                                                                          
                                                                                                                      
Perl has historically been used for text processing and manipulation.                                                 
My talk will describe a system which I built in Perl while working at                                                 
mgrok (www.mgrok.com) that extends some of these features to video.                                                   
                                                                                                                      
The system allows a user to manually input events, or to plug in modules                                              
that automate the process of finding events in a video stream.  The user                                              
need not input both the start and end time of the event, but can enter                                                
an approximate time and define a time envelope which will include a                                                   
sufficient window to capture the whole event.                                                                         
                                                                                                                      
Once the events are found, the system builds a data structure which                                                   
allows searching and editing of the video.                                                                            
                                                                                                                      
I will concentrate on how I put the system together, making extensive                                                 
use of existing modules, and will devote sufficient attention to                                                      
explaining the details so that my talk is technical and interesting.
