AxKit - Moving beyond static content with taglibs and providers                                                       
                                                                                                                      
When developers start working with AxKit, their first thoughts are                                                    
creating static XML pages and rejoicing in the separation of content                                                  
and display that stylesheets provide.  However, once developers move                                                  
beyond simple websites, AxKit provides two ways to aid in the                                                         
generation of dynamic content.  Taglibs provide custom tagsets for use                                                
in your pages, while providers are used to create modules that work                                                   
like mod_perl handlers.  This talk will compare and contrast these two                                                
approaches to dynamic content and provide examples of when each would                                                 
be most useful for a site.
