Abstract:                                                                                                             
Fotango have recently finished a project that has been relatively large                                               
in scope.  We were trying out several new ideas with the project, and                                                 
have learnt a lot from the experience.  The project was a success, but                                                
some things went better than others.   In general the talk will detail                                                
how we did what we did, why we did what we did, and how we would do                                                   
better next time.  Specifically it will discuss code reusability,                                                     
separation of layers and concerns, programmer's workspaces, open                                                      
source, agile modeling, test first development, merciless refactoring,                                                
team autonomy, and a shared team goals.
