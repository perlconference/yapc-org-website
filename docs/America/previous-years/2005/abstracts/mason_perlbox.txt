I will hold a discussion on the rapid creation of voice enabled                                                       
applications using Perlbox Voice Application Framework to interface with                                              
Sphinx2 and Festival speech systems. Perlbox Voice Application Framework                                              
allows applications to utilize voice recognition and speech synthesis                                                 
through a single transparent interface. This single interface                                                         
provides the ability to dynamically create new language models in a                                                   
sensible manner as well as access to many of the important features                                                   
offered by Festival and Sphinx. Beyond the specific discussion on Perlbox,                                            
I intend to include a discussion on general methods for adding voice                                                  
support to any perl application.
