Description:                                                                                                          
Modules are the basic building block for structured programming in Perl. In                                           
this session you will learn how to use the ExtUtils::ModuleMaker facility                                             
to automatically construct all the base files needed by a well-engineered                                             
module, and tools and strategies for converting existing code into                                                    
well-engineered modules to promote code reuse and maintainability. Also                                               
covered are ModuleMaker's interactions with Test::More, Module::Build, and
