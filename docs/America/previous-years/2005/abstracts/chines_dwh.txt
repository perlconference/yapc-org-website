There are many ways of exiting a Perl program.  The ability to set traps to                                           
customize warn and die signals, plus the variety of methods available in                                              
the Carp module give Perl programmers a lot of flexibility in dealing                                                 
with abnormal situations.  This talk will discuss how to use this wealth                                              
of options to best advantage and offers examples of when to use each                                                  
method of terminating a program.  Make sure your programs die honorably,                                              
providing the all of information needed to trace and correct the                                                      
problem, and avoid unnecessary clutter.
