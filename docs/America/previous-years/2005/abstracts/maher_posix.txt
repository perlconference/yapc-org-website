                                 ABSTRACT                                                                             
                                                                                                                      
The "select" loop of the POSIX shells is unique in two ways; 1)                                                       
it's arguably the friendliest feature of any UNIX shell, and 2)                                                       
it's the only shell loop missing from standard Perl.                                                                  
                                                                                                                      
But what's it like?  In the Shell::POSIX::Select implementation, it                                                   
resembles a Perl foreach loop, but that's as far as the similarity                                                    
goes.  Instead of assigning each list value in turn to the loop                                                       
variable for one iteration, it does something more interesting                                                        
and valuable.  Specifically, it displays a numbered menu of list                                                      
items, prompts for a selection, validates the selection and issues                                                    
appropriate feedback, assigns the selected value to the loop   
variable, and then runs an iteration.  So instead of blindly                                                          
iterating over a list, select iterates only over the values                                                           
*selected* from the list.                                                                                             
                                                                                                                      
This talk shows Perl programmers how to create terminal-based                                                         
menu-oriented programs without writing any of the associated                                                          
infrastructure.  Sample programs include one that composes a                                                          
regular expression from a menu of metacharacters and then displays                                                    
its matches, and another that lets users navigate and view Perl online
