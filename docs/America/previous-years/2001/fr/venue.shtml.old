      YAPC::NA 2001 will be held on the campus of <a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill
      University</a>, located in the heart of downtown 
      <a href="http://www.tourism-montreal.org">Montr&eacute;al</a>,
      <a href="http://www.tourisme.gouv.qc.ca/index_en.html">Qu&eacute;bec</a>, Canada. 


      <p><b>Language:</b> Located in Canada's French-speaking province, Montr&eacute;al
      is a dynamic, multicultural multilingual city with a touch of
      European flavour. Unilingual English-speakers will have no difficulty in downtown
      Montr&eacute;al, where they will hear French being spoken all around but will still be
      able to speak English to almost anyone they meet. Those with no knowledge of French 
      are advised to learn or note some basic French which they may encounter on signs,
      menus, and bathroom doors. Those with basic French knowledge will almost certainly
      fare well, although Qu&eacute;becois French is subtly different from that of France.

      </ul>  


      <p><b>Currency:</b> All Canadian banks and exchange counters will accept
      US dollars to convert to Canadian dollars; most exchange counters will
      accept currency from elsewhere in the world, but it's usually a good
      idea to bring US or Canadian dollars anyhow. One Canadian dollar is
      worth around 0.65 US dollars (or, if you prefer, one US dollar makes
      about 1.50 Canadian dollars).

      <p><b>Climate:</b> In June, Montr&eacute;al will be pleasantly
      warm (15-20&deg;C) without getting too humid. Evenings may be somewhat cool (10&deg;C).

      <p>
      As one of Canada's major metropolises, Montr&eacute;al is easily accessible to travelers
      coming from within and outside Canada.
  
      <p><b>By air:</b> Scheduled flights, international or otherwise,
      fly into Dorval Int'l Airport (CYUL). Getting from Dorval to
      downtown is a $28 (US$18) cab ride, an $11 (US$7) coach ride, or
      a $2 city-bus-and-subway ride. Charters fly into Mirabel (CYMX),
      which is quite a distance outside the city. Avoid if possible.
      <ul>

        <li><a href="http://www.admtl.com/dorval/en/4_transport/autobus-e.shtml">Airport Shuttle</a>
      </ul>

      <p><b>By train:</b> Montr&eacute;al is served by Canada's <a href="http://www.viarail.ca/">VIA
      Rail</a> and by <a href="http://www.amtrak.com">Amtrak</a>. Both of Montr&eacute;al's train
      stations -- Gare Centrale and Gare Windsor -- are located within a five-minute walk of
      the McGill campus.

        <li><a href="http://northeast.amtrak.com/adirondack/">Amtrak Adirondack</a> to Montr&eacute;al
      </ul>

      <p><b>By car:</b> Parking will be available on-site at around $5 (US$3) per day.
      Yahoo! Maps can give you <a href="driving.shtml">driving
      directions</a>. Remember, Canada is Metric: speed limits are measured in
      kilometres per hour, and fuel in litres. Staying within the speed limit is
      recommended on Qu&eacute;bec highways, where the provincial police might <i>not</i>
      speak English. <i>Important:</i> You cannot turn right on a red light in Qu&eacute;bec.

      <p><b>By bus:</b> Canadian and American bus lines, including
      Greyhound, Coach Canada, and Voyageur, stop at the
      Montr&eacute;al Terminus, which is a short M&eacute;tro (subway)
      ride from the McGill Campus.

      <a name="campus"></a>
      <p><hr size=1>
      <H3>On Campus</H3>

      <p><a href="http://www.mcgill.ca">McGill University</a>, one of
      two English universities in Montr&eacute;al, features a
      peaceful, green campus right in the middle of the city's
      downtown.
      
      <p>Unlike previous years, the conference, reception, and meals will take
      place in different buildings. All the buildings except the residences are
      within a few steps of each other; the residences (and downtown hotels) are
      about a five-minute walk away. The image above and the campus map below
      illustrate the venues:
      
      <div align="center">
      <p><a href="../images/map.jpg"><img width=190 height=168 align="middle" src="../images/t-map.jpg" border=1 alt="McGill map"></a>
      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      <a href="../images/campus.jpg"><img width=143 height=148 align="middle" src="../images/t-campus.jpg" border=1 alt="McGill campus"></a>
      </div>

      <p><b>To drive to the campus</b>, follow the <a
      href="driving.shtml">driving directions</a> which will take you
      to the McGill University gates; from there, turn right onto
      Sherbrooke Street, and then left onto University Street. Follow
      University Street all the way up the mountain, and take the last
      driveway to the right (which appears to lead to a football
      stadium) to reach the parking lot..
      
      <p><b>By M&eacute;tro</b>, take the <a
      href="http://www.stcum.qc.ca/English/metro/a-mapmet.htm">Green
      Line</a> to the McGill station. Find the University Street exit
      and walk north (uphill) until you see the University.

      <p>Rich Lafferty has a 
      <a href="http://alcor.concordia.ca/~rich/yapc/photo/">separate
      photo gallery</a> of some of the conference facilities.

      <H3>Accommodations</H3>

      As in previous years, we will be providing inexpensive accommodations in University 
      residences for those who desire them, and arranging special pricing for those
      who prefer hotels. <i>Unlike</i> previous years, there are a lot of hotels one block
      away from campus!

      <H4>McGill Residences</H4>

      <div align="center">
      <p><a href="../images/mcconnell.jpg"><img align="middle" width=186 height=128 src="../images/t-mcconnell.jpg" border=1 alt="McGill residence"></a>
      </div>

      <p>We will be obtaining a group rate from <a href="http://www.residences.mcgill.ca">McGill
      University Residences</a>. McGill has only single rooms, which are not air-conditioned.
      The residence rate will be at most $37.50 (US$25) per night, and probably somewhat lower.
      Internet access is available to guests in the hall at the centre of the residence complex,
      although wireless ethernet is not. Linens, towels and soap are provided for shared bathing
      facilities. A shared kitchen is accessible.
      <br><br>

      </div>

      <p>The residences are located at the base of Mount Royal Park, a short walk from the conference
      facilities.

      <H4>Hotels</H4>

      Right around McGill is what could be described as the hotel
      district of Montr&eacute;al.  McGill has arrangements with five
      hotels ranging from comfortable (Marriott) to luxurious
      (Ritz-Carlton). Please note that the Chateau Versailles is not
      as close to McGill as the others (about a fifteen minute
      walk). Information on the hotels and on how to obtain McGill
      University negotiated rates is available here:

      <p>There is <i>so</i> much to see in Montr&eacute;al that we couldn't begin
      to describe it all here; instead, we'll leave that up to the folks that
      do it best, with some useful links. We encourage you to spend the weekend following
      YAPC in Montr&eacute;al to discover the city.

      <p>For those feeling a bit of wanderlust, it's a short drive from Montr&eacute;al
      to Qu&eacute;bec City, the capital of the province of Qu&eacute;bec, and to 
      Ottawa, the capital of Canada.
