<p><b>DoubleTree Guest Suites</b></p>
<p>
The <a href="http://www.doubletree.com/en/dt/hotels/index.jhtml?moreDesc=true&ctyhocn=BCTYCDT" target="_new">DoubleTree Guest Suites</a> of Boca Raton have agreed to give a special room rate for YAPC attendees. 
<p>
<cite>
Hotel provides the ideal location. Conveniently located between Ft. Lauderdale and Palm Beach International Airports in the Arvida Corporate Park. Minutes to Boca Raton's finest beaches, world class shopping, dining, golf and tennis. Tropical Courtyard Setting with lushly landscaped oversized pool area. All suites include private living room and bedroom, microwave, refrigerator and coffee maker and our famous chocolate chip cookies upon arrival. Now offering wireless high speed internet access.
</cite>
<p>
The room rate is $59USD (plus tax) for up to 4 people in a suite. All rooms are suites! There is a complimentary breakfast (in case you want to eat before the breakfast at YAPC), free shuttle service to places within 5 miles (including the FAU campus), beer & wine Happy Hour Monday to Friday from 5:30-7:00pm, free parking, complimentary pass to Bally's Fitness, heated pool, whirlpool, wireless access (may be a charge), on-site restaurant and bar, and they are a part of the Hilton Honors program. It is within a few miles of the FAU campus, and 25 minutes from both Palm Beach Internation and Fort Lauderdal airports.
<p> 
The address is:
<br>
<address>
701 NW 53rd Street
Boca Raton, FL 33487
</address>
<p>
It is right off of Yamato Rd. near I-95. Their phone number is:
<p>
1-561-997-9500
<p>
Or, you can call any DoubleTree reservation line. Mention you are going to the "YAPC Perl Conference" to make sure you get the special rate. If you plan on arriving Saturday, or earlier, you may want to call directly to see if they will give you a super-special rate! But, these are great rates for a suite, especially if you double, triple or quad the occupancy.

<p><b>Dorms</b></p>
<p>
Dorm rooms will cost $28 for a single, and $20 for a double. Reservations will be taken, and payment will go directly to YAS. 
<br>
You can reserve a dorm room <a href="http://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node=dorm+info">here</a>!

<!--
<p><b>What is up with dorms?</b></p>

<p><B>Dorm rooms are available!!!</B>  They are $USD25 per person for a double room and $50 for a single.  Rooms are air conditioned and will have net access.  The dorm rooms are not on the <A HREF="http://www.wustl.edu/">Washington University</A> campus but on the <A HREF="http://www.slu.edu/">Saint Louis University</A> campus which is in Midtown and approximately 4 miles to the east of WU. Shuttles will be running between the campuses as well as public transportation [ WU is near a metrolink station and SLU has a station on campus ].  Online dorm registration is not yet available, but you can email <A HREF="mailto:sarah+yapcdorms@pound.perl.org">sarah+yapcdorms@pound.perl.org</A> with the dates you are interested in, your roommate, or if you would like for us to pair you with a roommate.  An email will go out later to inform you of online dorm registration and billing.</p>


<p><b>Why aren't the dorms at Washington University?</b></p>

<p>Washington University, the hosting campus, is unable to provide dorms for the conference due to construction projects scheduled over the summer for campus housing.</p>

<p><b>What about youth hostels?</b></p>

<p>There -is- a youth hostel in Saint Louis.  And it is inexpensive.  The downside
is that it's practically downtown.  On the upside, bring your bicycle and you can
bike it.  Or, if you're less industrious, we have a light rail system called Metrolink
that you can pick up downtown and ride to near campus.  Campus has shuttles running
to and from the Metrolink station.  More details on this later!

<br>Distance from campus: 8.1mi
<br>On Conference Shuttle Route: No
<br>Cost range: $15USD per night
