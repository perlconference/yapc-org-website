Perl 6 Design Philosophy

40 minutes                                                                                                            
                                                                                                                      
If you want to understand the choices language designers make, you have                                               
to understand what's behind the choices. What makes one feature more                                                  
desirable than another? What makes it Perlish? What makes it DWIM? How                                                
on earth does Larry decide? No, it's not a cosmic game of pin the tail                                                
on the donkey. Come take a guided tour through the rocks and rapids of                                                
language design. Leave with a better understanding of Larry, the changes                                              
in Perl 6, and the fundamental nature of Perl itself.                                                                 
                                                                                                                      
Note: 15 minutes of cognitive calisthenics are the recommended warmup                                                 
exercise for this talk. Feel that mental stretch!
