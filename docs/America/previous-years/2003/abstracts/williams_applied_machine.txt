Audience Type: Will be best for programmers.                                                                          
                                                                                                                      
Description:                                                                                                          
The talk will give an introduction to basic Machine Learning techniques                                               
(a compressed version of the "Introduction to Machine Learning with                                                   
Perl" tutorial from previous conferences), then show practical examples                                               
of how Machine Learning can be used to solve specific problems.                                                       
Examples will come from the fields of email filtering, biological data                                                
processing, and online content retrieval.                                                                             
                                                                                                                      
The talk will assume no prior experience with Machine Learning, but                                                   
will assume a basic level of familiarity with object-oriented Perl                                                    
programming.
