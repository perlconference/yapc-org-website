Parrot is a virtual machine used to efficiently execute bytecode for                                                  
interpreted languages. While Parrot is being developed, it is a                                                       
particularly good target for little languages - small, task-specific                                                  
languages. In particular, esoteric languages have been popular. This                                                  
talk will cover the little languages that currently run in Parrot,                                                    
along with implementation issues.
