Title:  Dates and Times in Perl                                                                                       
Length: 85 minutes                                                                                                    
                                                                                                                      
Date and time manipulation is deceptively complicated.  There's UTC, TAI,                                             
time zones, leap seconds, epochs in many flavors, date math, Daylight                                                 
Saving Time, and more.  First, we'll cover what those terms (and more) all                                            
mean.                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                      
Then we'll take about what you might want to do with dates and times as a                                             
programmer.  There's parsing, formatting, date math, date sets, and                                                   
dealing with different calendars.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                      
There are too many date and time modules for Perl, plus Perl's built-ins,                                             
so we'll take a look at a whole bunch of them, with a focus on a few big                                              
players, including Date::Calc, Date::Manip, Graham Barr's TimeDate                                                    
modules, and finally my project, the Perl DateTime module suite.`
