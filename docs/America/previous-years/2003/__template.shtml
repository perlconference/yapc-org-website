      <H3>Call for Participants</H3>

      <p>The call for participants for YAPC 2001 was issued on January 4, 2001, and
      is available below. If you are interested in giving a talk at YAPC, please
      read the CFP and note the directions within.
      <ul>

      <H3>Schedule</H3>

      <p>The schedule of talks for YAPC::NA 2001 is not yet available. The
      preliminary schedule will be posted here and announced in the 
      <a href="index.shtml#news">Breaking News</a> section of the main page.

      <H3>Lightning Talks</H3>
         
      <p>Have you done a project you want to tell people about? Do you have an
      idea you want to throw out for discussion? Are you looking for people
      to help you build something? Do you want to proclaim a manifesto? Have
      you used a module that you think should be better-known?

      <p>But maybe you don't have enough material for a twenty-minute talk, or
      maybe you never gave a talk before and you would like to start small.

      <p><b>Lightning Talks</b> will be sessions with consecutive
      five-minute talks. You should be prepared to get on the stage
      immediately, explain your idea, and then leave immediately. If you
      want to take questions, you do it in the hallway after the session.

      <p>We will almost <i>certainly</i> be featuring Lightning Talks at YAPC::NA
      2001, but details are not yet finalized. Any news will be posted on the
      <a href="index.shtml#news">main page</a> and here.
