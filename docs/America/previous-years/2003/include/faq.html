<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>This faq is maintained by freeside.  Besides this web
page, I don't have anything to do with planning YAPC.  Ask
me questions, but don't expect me to actually interfere with
the running of the event!</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="uc"><H2>Where exactly will the conference be held?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>Look for "UC" (University Center) on the <A
HREF="http://www.fau.edu/map/bocamap1.html">campus map</A>
in grid C2.  Mouseover until you see the <A
HREF="http://wise.fau.edu/student/univctr/offices/liveoak.htm">Live
Oak Pavilion</A>.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="dormindian"><H2>What are the housing options?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>Most people are staying at the DoubleTree.</P>

<P>On campus housing is available in the "Indian River"
buildings.  These are newly built facilities.  On the <A
HREF="http://www.fau.edu/map/bocamap1.html">map</A>,
mouseover "DM" to the southeast of "UC".</P>

<P>Previously, several room options were available, but
there was no information about how they were different.  Due
to the uncertainty, very few people registered for the dorms
--- something like 20 out of 150 attendees.  Now we're just
going to go with the Indian River rooms.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="doubletree"><H2>How do I get to the Doubletree?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>They claim it is a short, $5 rail trip to and from the
airports. They also have a free shuttle to and from the
Campus and other local spots.  So you don't need to rent a
car.</P>

<P>Here are the schedules for tri-rail (from Miami or Ft. Lauderdale
airports to Boca Raton).</P>

Weekdays: <A HREF="http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/ntm_wday.htm">http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/ntm_wday.htm</A>
<BR>Weekends: <A HREF="http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/ntm_wend.htm">http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/ntm_wend.htm</A>

<P>Schedules for the reverse direction (or from West Palm beach airport)
are here:</P>

<P>The hotel is very close (walkable) from the Boca Raton tri-rail stop.</P>

<P>There's a fare calculator at: <A HREF="http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/fare_calculator.htm">http://tri-rail.com/schedules_fares/fare_calculator.htm</A></P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="resnet"><H2>Can I get online from the dorms?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>Bring an ethernet cable.  You need an FAU account to get
access.  Biz is getting one for all of us to share.  Watch
this space for configuration information.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><H3>Are the dorm bathrooms shared?</H3></DIV>

<P>No.  Everybody gets their own.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><H3>Do the dorms have AC?</H3></DIV>

<P>This is Florida.  Are you kidding?</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="yapcreg"><H2>Do I have to register for the conference separately from the dorms?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030424</FONT></DIV>

<P>Yes.  Do that <A HREF="https://donate.perl-foundation.org/index.pl?node=Registrant+Info&conference_id=400">here.</A></P>

<P>When you register for the conference, you automatically join the <A HREF="http://mail.pm.org/mailman/listinfo/yapc">yapc mailing list</A>.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="thurfrisat"><H2>Should I stick around for Thursday, Friday, Saturday?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>Most people return to the real world on Thursday.</P>

<P>Dorms are open until checkout on Friday the 20th.
There's <A
HREF="http://yapc.org/America/venue.shtml#boca">lots to do
in Boca</A>, but you have to decide how much of it needs to
be done in the dog days of June.  Personally, I love
exploring, so I'm going to rent a car with a good A/C, take
a mini vacation, and get to know South Florida.  I hear they
have <A HREF="http://www.cnn.com/2003/TRAVEL/DESTINATIONS/04/23/butterfly.world.ap/index.html">butterflies</A>!  And alligators!</P>


<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="org"><H2>When should I arrive?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>Sunday the 15th.  The dorms don't officially open earlier
than that.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="nosat"><H2>So the dorms won't be open on a Saturday night?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>If arriving on Sunday makes your plane tickets more
expensive, go ahead with a Saturday ticket.  Biz may be able
to give you a room key.  <A HREF="mailto:yapc@jbisbee.com">Write to him</A> for details.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="food"><H2>What's up with food?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>Included in your YAPC fee is a daily breakfast, coffee
break, boxed lunch, and second coffee.  On Tuesday night
we'll have a big group dinner, but the rest of the time,
feel free to explore Florida's exciting cuisine.</P>


<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="fun"><H2>What about Organized Fun?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P><B>Matrix Reloaded</B>: Veterans who remember the very
first YAPC (held in the previous century in an old steel and
mining town in western Pennsylvania) will recall that perl
mongers stormed a local movie theater and watched The
Matrix.  We will revive this tradition at this YAPC by
storming a local movie theater to watch the sequel to The
Matrix.  This is a voluntary event, planned after the
Tuesday night YAPC dinner.  The generous fat cats from South
Florida have run a sponsorship drive so tickets
will be available at a heavily discounted price; you will
need to arrange your own ride to the <A
HREF="http://muvico.com/main/muvico_palace.htm">Muvico
Palace</A>.  It may seem <A
HREF="http://www.dinnerreviews.com/palm_beach.htm">frighteningly
fancy</A>, but basically we just have a theater to
ourselves.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="parking"><H2>What about parking?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>People staying in the dorms and have cars will get
parking passes.  Those people who just park on campus during
the day will use parking lot #15.  (there will be a map out
soon with hilighted areas of interest and distances)</A>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="merch"><H2>I want to spend money.  Are there merchandising tie-ins?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Thursday 20030529</FONT></DIV>

<P>freeside designed a couple of YAPC t-shirts which you can
buy at <A
HREF="http://www.cafepress.com/freeside">cafepress.</A>
Proceeds benefit YAPC.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="proposal"><H2>Where can I learn more?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P>See the <A HREF="http://southflorida.pm.org/yapc/">original proposal</A> which is a snapshot from a few months ago and may now be out of date.</P>

<DIV ALIGN=CENTER><A NAME="org"><H2>Who's running the show?  Can I help?</H2></A>
<FONT SIZE=-2>Monday 20030421</FONT></DIV>

<P><B>Boojum</B> was the YAPC Pumpqueen for 2002.  By the
end of the affair, she was stressed out and not having much
fun.</P>

<P>In 2003, <B>{KM}</B> (Kevin Meltzer) is the YAPC
Pumpking, and <B>biz</B> (Jeff Bisbee) is helping out.
