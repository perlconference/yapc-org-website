Lightning Talks</h2>

Mark-Jason Dominus et alii</h3>
<i>Friday, 1:30 PM in Rangos III.</i><i></i>
<p>See <a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/talks-2000.html ">http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/talks-2000.html</a>
<p>Lightning Talks are sixteen five-minute talks in a ninety-minute time
slot. We're going to be doing them at YAPC 19100 in Pittsburgh
<h3>
Why Would You Want to do a Lightning Talk?</h3>
Maybe you've never given a talk before, and you'd like to start small.
For a Lightning Talk, you don't need to make slide, and if you do decide
to make slides, you only need to make three. Maybe you're nervous and you're
afraid you'll mess up. It's a lot easier to plan and deliver a five minute
talk than it is to deliver a long talk. And if you do mess up, at least
the painful part will be over quickly.
<p>Maybe you don't have much to say. Maybe you just want to ask a question,
or invite people to help you with your project, or boast about somthing
you did, or tell a short cautionary story. These things are all interesting
and worth talking about, but there might not be enough to say about them
to fill up thirty minutes.
<p>Maybe you have a lot of things to say, and you're already going to give
a long talk on one of them, and you don't want to hog the spotlight. There's
nothing wrong with giving several Lightning Talks. Hey, they're only five
minutes.
<p>On the other side, people might want to come to a lightning talk when
they wouldn't come to a long talk on the same subject. The risk for the
attendees is smaller: If the talk turns out to be dull, or if the person
giving the talk turns out to be a really bad speaker, well, at least it's
over in five minutes. With lightning talks, you're never stuck in some
boring lecture for forty-five minutes.
