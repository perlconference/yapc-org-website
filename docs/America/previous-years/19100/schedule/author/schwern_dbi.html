DBI Intro and Class::DBI Walkthrough</h2>

<h3>
Michael Schwern</h3>
<i>Friday, 9 AM in Rangos III.</i>

See <a href="http://www.pobox.com/~schwern/papers/Class-DBI/">http://www.pobox.com/~schwern/papers/Class-DBI/</a>

<p>How does one take a real world thing: a user on a chat system; a film
review; a set of airplanes sitting on a runway... and translate that simultaneously
into a Perl class AND a RDBMs table, with one interface, one set of rules
and one set of documentation. Oh yeah, it has to be fast, portable, simple
to use and fully inheritable.&nbsp; This is what Class::DBI has set out
to do, but it hasn't quite reached that goal.
<p>We're going to do an in-order walkabout through a real world example
of inheritance in-depth.&nbsp; Books are nice for learning programming
theory, but there's nothing like a good code review to air out some of
the exceptions that more often than not wind up as rules.&nbsp; Along the
way we'll hit upon issues such as practical inheritance, stupid autoloading
tricks, lazy persistence, DBI, run-time type inspection, a little symbol
table hacking and pseudohashes.&nbsp; As this is an incomplete work there's
lots of interesting problems scattered about the code, some solved, some
not, and I'm sure more than a few mistakes will pop out.&nbsp; We'll dig
into them a bit and discuss what led to them and how they might be resolved.
<p>This is the full version of the extremely cut down talk which will be
given at TPC this year.&nbsp; As such it will not simply be a repeat of
the same material, but a major expansion along with much more opportunity
for audience discussion (Class::DBI does alot of Odd Things which will
need thrashing out) both because of the extra time and the expected higher
overall experience level of the audience.
