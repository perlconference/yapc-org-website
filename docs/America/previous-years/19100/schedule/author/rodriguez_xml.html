<h2>
A review of Perl XML modules</h2>

<h3>
Michel Rodrigues</h3>
IEEE Standards Activities
<p><i>Thursday, 1:30 PM in Rangos III.</i>
<p>See <a href="http://standards.ieee.org/resources/spasystem/twig/perl_xml/perl_xml.html">http://standards.ieee.org/resources/spasystem/twig/perl_xml/perl_xml.html</a>
<p>This talk is based on an article reviewing Perl XML modules (likely
to appear on xml.com).
<br>&nbsp;
<br>There are about 25 modules in the XML category on CPAN, plus 2 bundles,
plus some more XML related modules in other categories. What exactly does
each of them do? In which state are they? Which ones should you use?
<br>&nbsp;
<br>This talk should give an answer to the first two questions and give
you enough information to be able to answer the last one.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>It will consist in an overview of most of the XML modules, by category,
add some more details on the most widely used ones, starting with XML::Parser,
explain the roles of the various W3C standards and which modules implement
them and what are the relationships between modules.
<p>Then some examples for transformation modules will be given, in order
to give a feel of how to use them.
