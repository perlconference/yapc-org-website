External Object Support in Perl</h2>

<h3>

<p>Perl provides reasonable support for object oriented programming within
the language.&nbsp; Access to external objects (COM/CORBA/XPCOM/etc) however
is only provided through additional modules.&nbsp; This means that the
compiler cannot help with early binding to method calls nor can it verify
the correct spelling of property names.&nbsp; And at runtime there is an
additional layer of lookups and indirection involved.
<p>This talk presents a proposal for a generic external object mechanism
for Perl.&nbsp; It will provide access to type libraries during compilation
and dynamically definable opcodes for runtime dispatch.&nbsp; Some of the
issues covered are support for optional strong typing, memory layout for
classes/structures, calling (potentially overloaded) class and instance
<br>methods and accessing class and instance variables.&nbsp; These techniques
could also be used to access arbitrary code from platform specific shared
libraries.
<p>The outlook will be on defining "external" components in Perl and inheriting
from existing ones.
