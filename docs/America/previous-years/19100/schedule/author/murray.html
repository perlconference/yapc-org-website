See <a href="http://www.phreeow.net/YAPC-19100/ToolTeams.html">the paper at http://www.phreeow.net/YAPC-19100/ToolTeams.html</a>.
<p>In an effort to work around the common problems that arise when designing,
scheduling, and building supporting tools for a large development team,
and experimental team organization was developed and implemented.&nbsp;
Its goals were:
<ul>
<li>
increase re-use</li>

<li>
increase knowledge</li>

<li>
increase tool documentation</li>

<li>
increase awareness of tool development with management</li>

<li>
improve configuration management for tools</li>
</ul>
Deliverable software usually handles these issues quite well, but tools
tend to be created by individuals for a specific task with little or no
external communication.&nbsp; Consequently they are typically undocumented
and poorly managed, and any insights obtained during their development
are not passed on to other developers.&nbsp; These deficiencies are addressed
by a novel organizational structure that encourages local tool development
by specific teams (allowing developers with domain-specific knowledge to
continue building tools that they need) while still providing central organization
and distribution.
<p>This topic is part of my upcoming book, <u>Perl Tools</u>, to be published
by <a href="http://www.manning.com">Manning</a> some time this summer.
