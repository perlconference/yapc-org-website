Programming for the People</h2>

<p>As we leave the post-industrial era and enter the information age, programming
will increasingly be deemed an essential skill.&nbsp; Similar to the efficiency
and enabling benefits achieved by wordprocessing replacing dictaphones;
so too will creating software to build one's own business solutions result
in giving people the power to control their computers and produce results
through a cost effective and easy to implement means.
<p>The question is, how does Open Source Software help bridge this digital
divide of OSS by and for early adopters to include the late adopters and
even luddites?&nbsp; To some extent we are already part way there.&nbsp;
The bar has been lowered with respect to cost, freeware is after all free,
thus expense is not a barrier.&nbsp; Similarly, many in the community are
working at making applications both powerful and easy to use.&nbsp; For
example, Zope allows even non-programmers to manage simple websites with
little training.&nbsp; The Community needs to continue in this vein of
empowerment, of encouraging a much larger audience of people to participate
in infrastructure software development, in effect computer programming
for everyone.
