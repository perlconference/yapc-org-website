QRC: perl-based software for coordinating an online reference service</h2>

<h3>

<p><i>Friday, 2:15 PM in Rangos I.</i>
<p>QRC is a software package whose job is to coordinate the operation of
an online reference service or help desk.&nbsp; The project was inspired
by Hypermail and Req, but incorporates many new ideas as well.&nbsp; This
software has now been in active use (and development) for about five years,
and is deployed by several libraries throughout the world.&nbsp; The QRC
software serves as a good example of the kinds of projects that Perl is
good for, and the code uses many advanced Perl techniques which I will
point out and demonstrate.
