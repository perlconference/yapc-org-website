Virtual Conferencing with Perl</h2>

<h3>
Adam Turoff and Sarah Burcham</h3>
<i>Friday, 9:45 AM in Rangos I.</i>
<p>Perl Monger groups around the world come in many different shapes and
sizes. Some are quite active, while others meet infrequently.&nbsp; Some
are very social, while others are distinctly technical in nature.&nbsp;
Some contain very many members of the local Perl community, while others
are more spread out with sparse membership.
<p>The founding vision of the Perl Mongers is "to help Perl people meet
other Perl people."&nbsp; One way to do this is by reaching out to other
Perl communities and holding "virtual meetings".&nbsp; In this talk, we
describe the concept of a virtual technical meeting, how to host and attend
such meetings and lessons learned from holding these meetings.&nbsp; Configuration
of the 'slideshow' modules used to publish presentations used in these
<br>meetings will be discussed as well.
