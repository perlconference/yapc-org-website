<h2>
Pseudohashes: the Bastard Data Type</h2>
Michael Schwern
<p><i>Thursday, 4:15 PM in Rangos III.</i>
<p>Pseudohashes lurched into being somewhere around 5.005.&nbsp; Not quite
a hash, not quite an array and not nearly well enough documented, they've
floated around in the back of the feature list behind things like threading
and the Perl compiler.&nbsp; We'll try to get to know this misunderstood
monster and see if it deserves to live or die as a Perl feature.
<p>The basic concepts and use of pseudohashes will be explained along with
its justification for existance.&nbsp; We'll examine the cases when they
should and should not be used and their advantages and disadvantages over
conventional techniques.&nbsp; We'll also poke into the fields and base
modules and the opportunities they present for providing Perl with a more
conventional OO system and how they fall short of that mark.&nbsp; If time
permits, we'll dig around a bit in the perl source code to see how psuedohashes
work.
<p>The audience is expected to already be comfortable with arrays, hashes,
references and objects.&nbsp; A little knowledge of C and the Perl internals
wouldn't hurt as we'll be making a short detour into the perl source code.&nbsp;
What documentation is available about pseudohashes can be found in the
perlref man page, as well as the docs for the fields and base modules.
<p>This talk should eventually spawn a tutorial man page about pseudohashes
for inclusion in the core.
