<a name="diary"><h2>A YAPC Diary</h2></a>
Uri Guttman has written down some of his Thoughts in a 
<a href="uri-diary">Diary</a> of YAPC 1999. 

    <A NAME="yapc"><H2> What the heck is <CODE>yapc</CODE>? </H2></A>
    
    <P>
       <CODE>yapc</CODE> is "yet another perl conference," with apologies to
       <A HREF="http://conference.perl.com/">The Perl Conference</A>.  This is 
       an inexpensive conference with its roots in the 
       <A HREF="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</A> perl users groups.
    </P>

    <P>
       While The Perl Conference plays an important role in the Perl 
       community, there are some things that fall through the cracks 
       at such a large, relatively corporate conference.  Attendance
       fees of $1,000 or more are prohibitive, especially to students
       (though there are deep student discounts); furthermore, the 
       conference is on the West Coast, incurring travel expenses for
       those in the east, on top of the conference expense.  Finally,
       <CODE>yapc</CODE> is driven from the bottom up, organized
       by and for perl users -- a grassroots conference.
    </P>

    <P>
       It can also be thought of as a smaller, regional version of 
       TPC in the Eastern USA, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University.
       While CMU is hosting it this year, we hope to move it around
       the East and have it hosted by various 
       <A HREF="http://www.pm.org">Perl Monger</A> groups.
    </P>

    <P>
       We've had great feedback so far, and the list of attendees
       is growing -- Larry Wall has agreed to give our opening plenary
       talk, and Randal Schwartz, Mark-Jason Dominus, Joseph Hall, Chris
       Nandor and other luminaries far too numerous to enumerate 
       will be attending, and likely speaking.  You might want to 
       take a look at our current <A HREF="schedule.html">schedule</A>.
    </P>

    <A NAME="location"><H2> Location </H2></A>

    <P>
        The first <CODE>yapc</CODE> will be held at 
        <A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</A>
        in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  CMU has been most gracious about 
        all arrangements; an academic environment like this is one of the
        bastions of free speech, the humanities, and technical innovation 
        that make it possible for us to have open discussions.
