<h1>YAPC::Europe::2004 in Belfast</h1>

<br><br><br>
<h2>YAPC::EU::2004 Venue Chosen</h2>

YAPC::Europe 2004 will be held in Belfast, Northern Ireland, from the
<b>15th to 17th September</b>.  The theme will be <b><i>Perl for Profit</i></b>, using a
liberal definition of "profit".
<p>
Although it is close to the western edge, Belfast is easy to reach with
regular flight connections from the rest of Europe.  The conference
venue is right in the heart of the city, close to the main transport
hubs, accomodation, shopping areas, restaurants, and (of course) bars.
<br><br><br>
More details will be available in the near future.
