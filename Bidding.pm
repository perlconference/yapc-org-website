YAPC::Bidding - Guidelines and requirements for hosting YAPC

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Facilities, Catering, Accommodation, Equipment, Transportation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) is an inexpensive, grassroots
conference on the Perl programming language aimed at beginners and
experts alike, organized by Yet Another Society, Inc., a non-profit
corporation. It traditionally lasts three days, with the first day
being comprised largely of tutorials, and the latter two of workshops
and seminars.

This document describes the general venue requirements for a Yet
Another Perl Conference (YAPC) in some detail.  If you have any
questions, suggestions, or would like to propose to host YAPC, contact
Kevin Lenzo at the Yet Another Society, <lenzo@yetanother.org>.

Five major topic areas (facilities, catering, accommodation, equipment,
and transportation) are addressed in turn.

=head1 Facilities

All facilities should be accessible by disabled persons, and held
in controlled temperature environments (air-conditioned or heated
as needed).

=item * Auditorium

A large lecture-hall style room, with seating, capable of holding
the full assembly.

=item * Meeting rooms

Three additional rooms with a total capacity approximately equal to
that of the full assembly.

=item * Dining Area

A dining area capable of seating the full assembly for dinner.  The
area should have a public-address system, although Yet Another Society
may provide it.  It may be off-site, but must be near.

=item * Common area

A common area in which groups of attendees can informally meet and
in which conference registration can take place, and a number (6 or
so) tables for registration and information booths.

=item * Terminal room

A room capable of holding computers, to be used as a terminal room.
This room must have an internet network connection available to host
some 10-20 desktop computes and enough room for some 10-20 people to
connect with their own laptops, as well as tables and chairs.  The
network setup should be secured.

=item * Storage

A secure room in which to store supplies, including materials for all
the attendees and all necessary equipment.

=head1 Catering

Catering services. Breakfast, snacks, and a light lunch for three
days, plus one evening reception and one sit-down dinner.  About
25% of attendees will be vegetarian and 5% vegan; some may require
lactose-free or low-carbohydrate meals.  While not all meals may
be provided, the resources must be available; the amount of catering
is influenced by the amount of sponsorship.

=head1 Accommodation

Nearby commercial hotels, restaurants, and social venues must
be available.

Inexpensive dormitory-style accommodations for approximately half
the assembly is desirable. If the facility does not offer
accommodation, some nearby inexpensive accommodations, such as
hostels and campgrounds, should be identified. Ethernet (wired or
wireless) capabilities, and telephones, are desirable but not
required, as are linens and towels.

=head1 Equipment

=item * Auditorium and Meeting Rooms

Public address system, data projectors, transparency (overhead)
projectors, and both wired and wireless Ethernet.  Preferably
wireless microphones as well as podium mics.

=item * The Dining area

It must also have a PA system.   

=item * Terminal room

At least one Ethernet connection (ideally 100baseTX Fast Ethernet)
and sufficient AC power to provide power to a number computers and
monitors. Preferably, there would be working networked computers
in place, but these may be arranged by the Yet Another Society.

=item * Dedicated Internet addresses

These are not required (DHCP or NAT are both acceptable) but an
unfiltered connection to the Internet is required.  Wireless access
(802.11b) may be present or provided by Yet Another Society.

=head1 Transportation

Nearby access to an Airport, preferably a large one.  Parking
facilities or arrangements, as appropriate.  How to arrive by
public transport and taxi from the airport, or other major points.
