The files in: yapc.org

Are the current site that is live on the internet

There is an app.psgi file in the yapc.org directory that makes it easier to view the static
pages while editing them. Just cd to the yapc.org directory and run ```plackup```.

The files in: yapc_org

Are the old site with the generated code that seems b0rked or not-in-use or whatever

Please note that the files in here are a clone of my .svn repo and as such have .svn data in with them



----OLD TEXT--- 
What is this?

The documents in this project are the compiled knowledge of how
to run a grass-roots conference. They have been pulled together
by The Perl Foundation to help us from year to year since we always
have new organizers, but they're here to help anyone.

What's the funny mark-up in the files?

These files are written in a markup language called plain old
documentation (POD) format. If you have a computer with perl on it,
you can type >perldoc YAPC.pm and read it. If you don't have
perl, you can probably just try to ignore the markup.

Questions?
