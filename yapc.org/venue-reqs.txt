Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) is an inexpensive, grassroots
conference on the Perl programming language aimed at beginners and
experts alike, organized by Yet Another Society, Inc., a non-profit
corporation. It traditionally lasts three days, with the first day
being comprised largely of tutorials, and the latter two of workshops
and seminars.

This is a list of the general requirements for a venue.  If you have
any questions, suggestions, or would like to propose to host YAPC,
contact Kevin Lenzo at the Yet Another Society, <lenzo@yetanother.org>.

Facilities.

   Auditorium. A large lecture-hall style room, with seating, capable
   of holding the full assembly.

   Meeting rooms. Three additional rooms with a total capacity
   approximately equal to that of the full assembly.

   Dining Area. A dining area capable of seating the full assembly
   for dinner.  The area should have a public-address system, although
   Yet Another Society may provide it.  It may be off-site, but must
   be near.

   Common area.  A common area in which groups of attendees can
   informally meet and in which conference registration can take
   place, and a number (6 or so) tables for registration and
   information booths.

   Terminal room. A room capable of holding computers, to be used as a
   terminal room.  This room must have an internet network connection
   available to host some 10-20 desktop computers and enough room for
   some 10-20 people to connect with their own laptops, as well as
   tables and chairs.  It should be secureable.

   Storage. A secure room in which to store supplies, including
   materials for all the attendees and all necessary equipment.

   All facilities should be accessible by disabled persons, and held
   in controlled temperature environments (air-conditioned or heated
   as needed).

Catering.

   Catering services. Breakfast, snacks, and a light lunch for three
   days, plus one evening reception and one sit-down dinner.  About
   25% of attendees will be vegetarian and 5% vegan; some may require
   lactose-free or low-carbohydrate meals.  While not all meals may
   be provided, the resources must be available; the amount of catering
   is influenced by the amount of sponsorship.

Accomodation.

   Nearby commercial hotels, restaurants, and social venues must
   be available.

   Inexpensive dormitory-style accommodations for approximately half
   the assembly is desireable. If the facility does not offer
   accommodation, some nearby inexpensive accomodations, such as
   hostels and campgrounds, should be identified. Ethernet (wired or
   wireless) capabilities, and telephones, are desirable but not
   required, as are linens and towels.

Equipment: A/V, Network

   Auditorium and Meeting Rooms. Public address system, data
   projectors, transparency (overhead) projectors, and both wired and
   wireless Ethernet.  Preferably wireless microphones as well
   as podium mics.

   The Dining area must also have a PA system.   

   Terminal room. At least one Ethernet connection (ideally 100baseTX
   Fast Ethernet) and sufficient AC power to provide power to a number
   computers and monitors. Preferably, there would be working
   networked computers in place, but these may be arranged by the Yet
   Another Society.

   Dedicated Internet addresses are not required (DHCP or NAT are both
   acceptable) but an unfiltered connection to the Internet is
   required.  Wireless access (802.11b) may be present or provided by
   Yet Another Society.

Transportation.  

   Nearby access to an Airport, preferrably a large one.  Parking
   facilities or arrangements, as appropriate.  How to arrive by
   public transport and taxi from the airport, or other major points.
