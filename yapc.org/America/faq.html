<p>
<ol class="faq">
  <li>What is YAPC?
      <div>YAPC is an acronym for Yet Another Perl Conference, a yearly Perl conference held 
      by Perl programmers for the Perl community.</div>

  </li>

  <li>When is YAPC?
      <div>June 25th through 27th. There will also be open classes that will be occurring 
      on June 28th and 29th.</div>
  </li>

  <li>How much does it cost?
      <div>Registration for YAPC is $100 US, but through April 30th the registration cost is 
      only $85 US. <!--The open classes following YAPC are $200 US each.--></div>
  </li>

  <li>When does the conference start?
      <div>The conference keynote addresses begin at 9:00 a.m. CST on Monday, June 25th. For 
      those who arrive early, there will be a session on "Conferences for Beginners" starting 
      at 8:30 a.m. This session is a great way for you to learn how to get the most from your 
      conference experience, so don't miss it.</div>
  </li>

  <li>When does the conference end?
      <div>The conference is officially over at 4:20 p.m. on Wednesday, June 27th. Immediately
      following the conference, there will be a town-hall meeting for members of the Perl 
      community to discuss the future of Perl. The town hall will probably last until around 
      5:00 p.m. Also, don't forget the bonus classes that will be held on June 28th and 29th.</div>
  </li>

  <li>What are the hours of the conference?
      <div>There will be conference-related activities going on Monday, June 25th through 
      Wednesday, June 27th from 8:30 a.m. CST to 5:00 p.m. CST each of those days. 
      Additionally, there will be a conference banquet and auction on the evening of Tuesday, 
      June 26th.</div>
  </li>
  
  <li>Is parking available?
      <div>Yes.  I'll update this information once we get the information about
      parking.  If you will need to park on campus, send a message to fluhmann
      at gmail.com.
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Sponsors</h3>
<p>
<ol class="faq">
  <li>How can my company sponsor YAPC?
      <div>There are many ways to sponsor YAPC. This includes cash donations, donation of 
      goods for auction, publicity and advertisement, and equipment loans. If you want to 
      help YAPC by becoming a sponsor, send a message to gwadej at anomaly.org for more 
      information.</div>
  </li>

  <li>What do I get for sponsoring YAPC?
      <div>You get the piece of mind of knowing that you have given back to the open source 
      community. You also get your name plastered across just about everything YAPC, including
      the conference website and the printed conference program. You also get your name 
      dropped a few times during the conference and have the freedom to put promotional items 
      in conference attendees swag bags. As an added bonus, if you are looking for some Perl 
      hackers to join your company, sponsors are invited to participate in a job fair to be 
      held during the conference.</div>
  </li>

  <li>How much money do you need?
      <div>The conference can run close to $20,000 US to produce. A large portion of that is 
      covered by attendee dues, but not all of it. We rely on sponsors to fill the gap and keep 
      YAPC affordable and accessible to all of the Perl community. Plus, all of the 
      additional funds go to the Perl Foundation who use the money to further the development 
      of the Perl language.</div>
  </li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>Speakers</h3>
<p>
<ol class="faq">
  <li>Can I present at YAPC?
      <div>Please do. All that you have to do is come up with some topic relevant to Perl 
      hackers. It doesn't have to be about Perl, but it at least has to be something that 
      most of the Perl hackers at the conference would like to hear about. Just submit a short 
      abstract of what you would like to present via this site by April 10th so that we can 
      review your proposal and let you know wether or not you are accepted.</div>
  </li>

  <li>If I am chosen as a speaker, do I have to pay for the conference?
      <div>Paid registration is complete voluntary for the conference if you are a speaker. 
      Registration is only $100 (or $85), but hey, we understand. If it wasn't for the 
      speakers, we wouldn't have much of a conference and $100 could buy a lot of beer.</div>
  </li>

  <li>I was chosen as a speaker, but I've already paid for registration. What do I do?
      <div>Just send a note to fluhmann at gmail.com 
      and let me know. I'll be sure that a refund is issued to you.</div>
  </li>
</ol>

</p>

<h3>Getting to YAPC</h3>

  <li>Where do I fly into?

      considering flying into: Bush Intercontinental and Hobby.</div>

      approximately seven miles south of downtown Houston, near I-45/Gulf Freeway, 
      the major highway heading from the City to NASA and Galveston Island.</div>
  </li>

  <!--li>What airline should I take to YAPC::NA?
      <div>American Airlines has agreed to providing discount fares to YAPC. Using the 
      discount code A2566AN you.ll be able to receive 5% off of American Airlines tickets for 
      travel to and from Chicago between June 24th 2006 and July 5th 2006. The discount 
      applies to most all tickets. details can be found below. Even if the discount doesn.t 
      apply to your ticket, if you do fly with American to get to YAPC, please use the 
      discount code. The Perl Foundation will get credit for every ticket sold under that 
      code.</div>
  </li-->
</ol>

<h3>Where to stay?</h3>
<p>
<ol class="faq">
  <li>Are there places to stay on campus?
      <div>Yes, Moody Towers is the largest complex of the residence halls and 
      accommodates more than 1,100 students. The two 18-story buildings are 
      joined by a main lobby, the Commons. The majority of the rooms house two 
      occupants, while single occupant rooms are available. Most floors have a

      showers. The first floor is wheelchair accessible and has a slightly 
      modified bathroom. The Towers provide a laundry facility, computer lab, 
      health club, cafeteria, and convenience store. Floor plans and more

      </div><br /><div>Attendees wishing to stay in more luxurious accommodations while 
      remaining on campus can stay at the Hilton University of Houston Hotel and 
      Conference Center. Located directly across the street from the University 
      Center, the Hilton University of Houston Hotel and Conference Center not 
      only provides the quality and services you have come to expect from the 
      Hilton name, but is also an integral part of the Conrad N. Hilton College 
      of Hotel and Restaurant Management. It serves as a unique, real world 
      laboratory for students and faculty. The facility provides 40,000 square

  </li>

      declining balance card (Cougar Cash) can be purchased and used at any of
