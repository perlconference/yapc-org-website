					<description>And what a fine book that &quot;Minimal Perl&quot; is!  It's chock full of insights from a Bell System insider as to how UNIX came to be the way it is, and how Perl eclipses its utilities in so many ways.  As a case in point, the &quot;Legend of Nexpr&quot; alone, which relates how two young Bell Labs new-hires got taken for $200 in a bar bet by &lt;i&gt;misunderestimating&lt;/i&gt; the mathematical capabilities of the &lt;b&gt;Shell/AWK&lt;/b&gt; combo (and by extension, Perl) is well worth the cover price!</description>
