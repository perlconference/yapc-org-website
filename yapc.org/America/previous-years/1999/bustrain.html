<h1>Directions from Amtrak and Greyhound stations</h2>
<p>
Both the Amtrak and Greyhound station are approximately on the corner of
Liberty Avenue and 11th Street in downtown Pittsburgh.
<p>
It is approximately 4 miles from either station to the Wyndham, and
another mile further to CMU campus. Both are accessible via bus or taxi,
although it is about a 1/4 mile walk to the most convenient station.


<h2>by Taxi</h2>
<dir>
Both available easily from each station.   Taxi is probably the most 
convenient way to go, and should be under $10.

<LI>Checker Cab: (412) 381-5600
<LI>Yellow Cab:  (412) 665-8100

<h2>by Bus</h2>
<dir>
Port Authority Gold is at (412) 442-2000 during typical business hours,
and their website is at 
<a href="http://trfn.clpgh.org/patransit">http://trfn.clpgh.org/patransit</a>.
<p>
The best buses to take (either way) are the 61A,B or C.  Schedules for
those buses are at the website, but generally they come every 15 minutes
during business hours.
<p>
It is $1.25 to travel between downtown to Oakland (where both the hotel
and campus are located) and it takes approximately 15-20 minutes to do
so.
<p>
From downtown to Oakland, the nearest stop is at the corner of Grant and
Fifth, on the South (farther) side of the street.  Bus stops are marked
with a sign and a booth there in front of the Castle-like city/county
government building.
