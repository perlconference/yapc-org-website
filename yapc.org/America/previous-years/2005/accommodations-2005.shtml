YAPC 2005 has booked blocks of rooms at three locations very near to the
conference.  These rooms will be held for a set period of time before
being released to the general public.  Since demand for hotel rooms in
Toronto is very high in the summer,
</p>

<div align="center">
       <b>
       DO NOT DELAY IN BOOKING YOUR ROOM!
       </b>
</div>

<p>
You may be thinking "Well if worst comes to worst I can always stay at
a motel."  However in reality it may be IMPOSSIBLE to find a room in
Toronto (or even near Toronto) after a certain point.  Our reserved
blocks of rooms will start being released to the general public in late
April, so book quickly.

</p>

<p>

YAPC 2005 has booked blocks of rooms at the following three locations:

<ul>
  <li> <a href="#chestnut">89 Chestnut Residence and Conference
  Facility</a> (location of the conference).</li>

  <li>Ryerson University: <a href="#illc">International Living Learning
  Centre (ILLC)</a> and <a href="#pitman">Pitman Hall Residence</a>
</ul>

<p>
There are also other accommodation facilities near the 89 Chestnut
Residence and Conference Facility that provide an alternative to the
above three locations.  (Rooms at these locations have not been
specially reserved for YAPC 2005 attendees):
</p>

<ul>
   <li><a href="#metropolitan">Metropolitan Hotel Toronto</a>

   <li><a href="#sheraton">Sheraton Toronto at 123 Queen</a>

   <li><a href="#marriott">Courtyard Marriott</a>
</ul>

<i><b>NOTE:</b> all prices below are listed in Canadian Dollars.  The exchange
rate as of April 7 2005 is $1 (US) == $1.22 (CDN).  Check <a
href="http://finance.yahoo.com/currency/convert?amt=1&from=USD&to=CAD&submit=Convert">here</a>

<h3>89 Chestnut Hotel/Dorm/Conference Facility</h3>
</a>

<p>
The conference facility is  89 Chestnut street [<a
href="http://maps.google.com/maps?q=89+Chestnut+St.+Toronto,ON&hl=en">map</a>],
which has both conference facilities and unique hotel/dorm hybrid rooms.  (See their
website -- <a href=http://89chestnut.com/>http://89chestnut.com/</a>)
These are basically hotel rooms but without a TV.  During the school
year they are used as dorm rooms for University of Toronto students,
and are used as hotel room throughout the summer months.  They are
only slightly more expensive than university dorm rooms and much less
expensive than proper hotel rooms in downtown Toronto.  This price/quality
combination plus the extreme convenience of having your room in the same
building as the conference leads us to believe that most of the
attendees will opt for this option.

<p>

A block of rooms has been reserved for YAPC 2005 attendees for the
arrival date of Sunday June 26th, 2005, departing the morning of June 29,
2005 (i.e. a 3 night stay: Sunday, Monday, Tuesday).  (Some additional rooms
are booked as part of the reservation for the evening of Wednesday 29
June, departing the morning of Thursday 30 June.  This is for people
for whom travel plans or touristing interests would be helped by 
staying another night.) Features of the reserved block of rooms at
89 Chestnut include:

<ul>
  <li> A special rate of CDN $79 per single room per night, or CDN $89 per
    double-room per night.  There is in addition a 5% PST and 7% GST tax
    on accommodation. (So, including tax, a room is
    CDN $79 * 1.12 = CDN $88.48 and a double is CDN $89 * 1.12
    = CDN $99.68.)


  <li> 250 rooms have been reserved for June 26, June 27, and June 28.
    60 rooms have been reserved for June 29.

  <li> Rooms will be Run of House (i.e. no specific floors or blocks of
    adjacent rooms in the building have been reserved for YAPC.)

  <li> Extend your stay in Toronto -- conference attendees may arrive or
    depart up to 3 days outside of the main group use dates at the
    same room rate.  However, this must be booked in advance, at the
    original time of booking.  89 Chestnut is not obligated to provide
    you with a room if you decide during the course of the conference
    that you would like to stay later.

  <li> The above room rate includes a continental breakfast.  You may
    upgrade to a full breakfast by paying CDN $6 plus tax to the cashier.

  <li> Remaining rooms in the block not booked by Monday June 6, 2005 will
    be released for general sale to the public.  All requests after this
    date will be subject to availability.

  <li> Parking is based on availability.  The rate for overnight guests is
    CDN $23 for a 24-hour period.  This is a reasonable rate for parking
    in downtown Toronto. We don't recommend that people who come to
    Toronto by public transit (e.g. train, bus, airplane) rent a car
    while in Toronto, unless you want one for your own personal tourism
    purposes.  Nothing about the conference requires one.

  <li>  In-room high-speed internet access is available with a modem rental
    charge of CDN $5 per day.

  <li> Housekeeping is provided twice per 7-day stay, as opposed to daily
    housekeeping in most conventional hotel settings.

  <li> All rooms are non-smoking, and there are no smoking areas in the
    building.

  <li> You may cancel your reservation within 48 hours of your intended
    arrival without charge.  Cancellations received less than 48 hours
    prior to arrival will be charged one night’s accommodation rate.
    You may substitute the person(s) in your reservation up to the date
    of arrival.

  <li> Safe Booking Deadline:  Monday, June 6, 2005.

  <li> Booking Code: perl0626
</ul>
<p>
To make a reservation at 89 Chestnut, call +1 (416) 977-0707, extension
0 and ask the reception for the YAPC 2005 conference room rate.  The
booking code is "perl0626".  The accommodation may be settled by
MasterCard, VISA, or cash, no cheques accepted.
