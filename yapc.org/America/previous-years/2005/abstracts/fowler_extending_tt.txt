  "The Template Toolkit provides a mini language well suited to the                                                   
   creation of web pages and other text output, being optimised to make                                               
   doing things such as including other templates and variable                                                        
   interpolation simple, straightforward as clear as possible;  However,                                              
   it's deliberately not as powerful as Perl.                                                                         
                                                                                                                      
   This talk explains how to quickly write Perl extensions to the Template                                            
   Toolkit that can be called directly from within templates.  It covers                                              
   such things as:
