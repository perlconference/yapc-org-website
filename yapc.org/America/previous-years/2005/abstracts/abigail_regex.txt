Time:      3 hours.                                                                                                   
Abstract:  In this tutorial, we will introduce regular expressions.                                                   
           Starting from the absolute basics, we will gradually                                                       
           work our way up, and build more complex regular expressions.                                               
           We will discuss common regex constructs, advanced regex
