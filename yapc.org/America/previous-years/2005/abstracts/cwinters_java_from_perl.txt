  Generating Java with Perl                                                                                           
                                                                                                                      
Abstract:                                                                                                             
----------------------------------------                                                                              
                                                                                                                      
Not everyone has the benefit of a full-time Perl job -- but that                                                      
doesn't mean it's shut out. Perl, particularly with the Template                                                      
Toolkit, has wonderful utility as a code generation tool, even for                                                    
code consumed by other compilers.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                      
In this case, Perl is generating Java, and lots of it. (Some XML files                                                
too.) One of the overlooked benefits of the J2EE (Java 2 Enterprise                                                   
Edition) platform is the opportunity for Perl programmers to generate                                                 
all the different classes, interfaces and deployment descriptors from                                                 
different sources of metadata.                                                                                        
                                                                                                                      
This presentation will discuss the benefits for an agile development                                                  
process as well as demonstrate how you can bump up your KLOCs by many,                                                
many factors.
