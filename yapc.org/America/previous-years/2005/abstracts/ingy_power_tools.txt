Title: New Power Tools for Module Authors                                                                             
Length: 3 hours                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                      
- Module::Install - This is the module that will eventually replace                                                   
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker and Module::Build as the framework for                                                          
  Makefile.PL. Why do I think that? Because Module::Install actually                                                  
  wraps around either ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Build or even both                                               
  at the same time. And it makes all the complicated things that you do                                               
  in Makefile.PL as easy as turning on a switch. Best of all it bundles                                               
  as much of itself as necessary into your module; automatically.                                                     
                                                                                                                      
- Module::Test - This is an autobundling test framework that is similar                                               
  in spirit to Module::Install. It allows people to create an endless                                                 
  number of reusable tests and share them between modules.                                                            
                                                                                                                      
- Module::Build - This is the underlying framework that is meant to                                                   
  eventually replace ExtUtils::MakeMaker.                                                                             
                                                                                                                      
- ExtUtils::AutoInstall - Allows module writers to specify a more                                                     
  sophisticated form of dependency information than the PREREQ_PM option                                              
  offered by ExtUtils::MakeMaker.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                      
- Test::FIT - FIT is a visual testing framework developed by Ward                                                     
  Cunningham. See http://fit.c2.com. Test::FIT provides a whole new way                                               
  for Perl module authors.                                                                                            
                                                                                                                      
- Module::Husbandry - A better way to create module distributions.                                                    
  Replaces the h2xs method.                                                                                           
                                                                                                                      
- Inline.pm - Combined with Module::Install, Inline makes it very easy 
  to create C based Perl modules.                                                                                     
                                                                                                                      
- only.pm - Allows you to install multiple versions of the same Perl                                                  
  module, and choose at runtime which one you want to use.                                                            
                                                                                                                      
- www.freepan.org - FreePAN is my new project to create a CPAN like                                                   
  facility for Open Source programs written in any programming language.
