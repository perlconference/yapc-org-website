<h3>How do I get to the venue?</h3>
<p>
To be announced.  A specific site within the University of Toronto has not
yet been finalized.  Details will be placed here when this has been done.
In general, the University of Toronto is in the heart of downtown Toronto.

<p>
<b>
Driving from points west and south -- coming through Buffalo and
Niagara Falls
</b>
<br>

Get onto the QEW Highway (signage is "QEW Toronto") -- just follow the
signs.  Take this into downtown Toronto.  Exit the
Yonge/Bay/York/University exit, go northbound on University Avenue
approximately 2 kilometres to the Ontario Provincial legislature.  You
are now surrounded by the University of Toronto on all sides.  When
the specific location within the university is determined then more
directions and a map will be made available here.

</p>

<p>
<b>
Driving from points west and south -- coming through Detroit and
Sarnia/Port Huron
</b>
<br>

Get onto the Highway 401 (eastbound to Toronto) -- just follow the
signs.  Coming through Sarnia/Port Huron get onto the Highway 402
until it joins with Highway 401 (approx. 70 miles/110km to the east).
Take this into Toronto, approx. 4 hours drive east of Detroit or 3
hours east of Sarnia/Port Huron.  Take Highway 427 South for
approximately 10 miles / 15 km to the QEW / Gardiner Expressway.  Take
the QEW eastbound to downtown Toronto.  Exit the
Yonge/Bay/York/University exit, go northbound on University Avenue
approximately 2 kilometres to the Ontario Provincial legislature.  You
are now surrounded by the University of Toronto on all sides.  When
the specific location within the university is determined then more
directions and a map will be made available here.

</p>

<p>
<b>
Driving from points north -- coming through Barrie, Northern Ontario and the
TransCanada Highway
</b>
<br>

You must be Canadian -- you figure it out yourself.  (Hint:  Hwy 400 south
to 401 east collectors to Avenue Road south.  Try not to get lost navigating
around Upper Canada College just north of St. Clair Ave.)

</p>

<p>
<b>
Driving from points east -- Ottawa, Montreal, New England
</b>
<br>

For New Englanders it may be just as easy to drive through Niagara
Falls / Buffalo.  Refer to those directions.  Or, you could take I-81
North through Watertown NY to Highway 401.

</p>
<p>

Take Highway 401 west into Toronto.  Take DVP (Don Valley Parkway)
south to the Bayview/Bloor exit.  Take Bloor Street East for approx. 5
kilometres to the University of Toronto.  Agonize and curse over
downtown Toronto traffic and swear that life is better wherever you
come from, unless you're from Montreal.  Then you can marvel at people
turning right at red lights and denegrate the local style of bagel-making.

</p>

<p>
<b>
Flying into Toronto Pearson International Airport (YYZ) -- coming from
 everywhere
</b>
<br>

Did you rent a car?  If so, take Highway 427 south.  From here, refer to the
directions for coming from points west and south (Detroit)

</p>

<p>
If not, just get the taxi guy to get you to the University of Toronto and
our specific venue location building (yet to be determined).
</p>

<p>
<b>
Coming into Toronto by Train, into Union Station -- coming from various places
</b>
<br>

Did you rent a car?  If so, take University Avenue about 2 km north to 
the University of Toronto.

</p>

<p>
If not, you can take a taxi -- just tell the guy where you need to be -- or
you can take the subway (inside of Union Station) north on the University/
Spadina Line to Queens Park subway station.
</p>

<p>
<b>
Coming into Toronto by inter-city bus -- arriving Downtown Toronto bus
terminal, Elizabeth Street building or Bay Street building
</b>
<br>

You could walk to the University from here, but that might be a pain with
luggage.  Take a taxi, it's easiest.

</p>

<h3>How do I get to the Hotel?</h3>
<p>
A hotel partner has yet to be determined.  Once we figure it out relevant
information will be put here.  It will be near the conference venue.

<h3>How do I get around Toronto?</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Public Transit</b>
<ul>
<li>
The TTC -- Toronto Transit Commission -- is the second-largest in
North America, and the best in terms of availability, reliability, and
frequency of service. The subway permiates the downtown area, and
there is an extensive system of "streetcars" (electric trollys on
tracks embedded in the road) that's even more ubiquitous.</li>
<li>Cash fare is CDN$2.25 per trip (including as many transfers as
necessary). Tokens can be bought; in packs of 10, the price comes down
to CDN$ 1.90 per trip. A "daypass" can be bought that provides
unlimited rides for CDN$ 7.75 (about USD$ 5.50) for a day.
