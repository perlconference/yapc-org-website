<h3>Attendance Details</h3>

<h3>Where do I park?</h3>
<p>You can park for free on campus in the Governors D and E lots. You can find these lots on the campus maps available on the UB <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/buildings/">maps page</a>. They are a short walk from the conference building. If you park anywhere else, you are very likely to get a ticket. Parking enforcement at UB is very efficient. If you are staying at the University Inn, you might consider walking or taking the shuttle.</p>

<h3>Where and when is registration check-in?</h3>
<p>Registration check-in will be available Tuesday evening, 6/15, from 4PM-8PM in the main hallway of same building in which we are holding the conference, the <a href="http://www.buffalo.edu/search/search?q=NSC">Natural Sciences Complex</a>. It will continue Wednesday morning starting at 7AM. Please register early if you can.</p>

<h3>What do I do about lunch?</h3>
<p>There are several places on campus to get lunch. The campus has an area of restaurants and shops called the Commons, and you'll find several options there. There is also a food court in the <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/cgi-bin/bldgloc?studnt">Student Union</a> called Putnam's. We will have signs posted to make it easy to find these locations.</p>

<h3>Will I have internet access?</h3>
<p>The Natural Sciences Complex has wireless access nearly everywhere. In the lower points of some of the rooms, the signal is weak, so we are working on adding wireless access points. All attendees will be given an account to log onto the network while at the conference, but you will need a wireless access card.</p>
<p>If you don't have a computer, we will have a terminal room sponsored by <a href="www.apple.com">Apple</a>. We plan to have 10 powerbook computers and 2 Apple G5 computers for use.</p>

<h3>Other Questions</h3>
<p>Other information is available on the conference <a href="travel_faq.shtml">travel page</a>.
