      <p>            University at Buffalo,<br>

<p>YAPC is a place for people to meet and talk about Perl -- where
people who've done interesting things, people who are working
on the language itself, people who are using it daily,
and people who are looking to learn about it are all within
arm's reach.  Some of the great authors and coders in the field
will be on hand to discuss their work, as well as the nature
and direction of Perl itself.

<p>Please join us for three days of listening, talking and learning about 
Perl in Buffalo.

  <li>This year we will accept a number of types of talks:
   <br><br>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Lightning:</b> <i>5 minutes</i>

       <p>Lightning talks are brief (5-minute) talks that focus on a                                                    
        single example, idea, project, or technique.  Lightning talks                                                 
        do not attempt to cover all aspects of their subject matter,                                                  
        but rather to present one facet of the idea clearly and                                                       
        succinctly.

	<p>To submit a proposal for a lightning talk, go to the <a href="http://www.justanotherperlhacker.org/lightning/index.shtml">lightning talk page</a>.

       <br><br>

     <li><b>Standard:</b> <i>20 minutes</i>

       <p>A standard talk is the preferred format.  This is enough 
       time to start a topic, introduce it with some pithy slides, 
       and open up to later conversation. 
       <br><br>

     <li><b>Long and Extra-Long:</b> <i>40 minutes, 85 minutes</i>

       <p>Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering
       large topics.  If you have an in-depth topic you would like
       to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable 
       discussion, a Long or Extra-Long talk may be the format of 
       choice.
       <br><br>

     <li><b>Tutorial:</b>  <i>3 hours + break (possibly in two sets)</i>

       <p>Half-day (or possibly full-day) tutorials. These tutorials tend to cover a wide range to material for a certain aspect of Perl programming. For example, an XML tutorial could cover XML basics, to writing XML, to parsing XML, to practical uses of XML.

     <li><b><font color='red'>New! </font>Poster:</b>  <i>Make a poster and attend Poster BOF</i>

       <p>A poster presentation is an opportunity to present what you are doing even if you aren't ready to do a lightning talk. Make a poster explaining something interesting you are doing with Perl, and we'll post it in the main conference hallway. We will have an after-hours Birds of a Feather slot scheduled to allow all poster presenters to meet any YAPC attendees with questions.</p>
     </ul>
   </ul>

Conference organizers reserve the right to change the length assigned to a talk, if deemed neccessary. If you want to speak on multiple topics, please submit a seperate proposal for each one. Include the following information with your submission: Name, address, email, biography, proposal title, type of talk, abstract (full description), brief description.
   <div align="center">
   <p><b>Please submit your abstracts to 
   &lt;<a href="mailto:na-author@yapc.org">na-author@yapc.org</a>&gt;!</b>
  </div>

  <p>If you'd rather not send email, we will have an on-line submission form available soon.</p>
<p>Thank you; we hope you will participate. If you have any questions,
please mail &lt;<a href="mailto:na-help@yapc.org">na-help@yapc.org</a>&gt;.
