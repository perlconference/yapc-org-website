<p><b>What is the cost of a room per day?</b></p>

<p>The cost is CAD $40.26 per room per day (approximately USD $26),
including taxes.</p>

<p><b>Can I share the room with another person?</b></p>

<p>Sorry, but McGill only offers single rooms (anyways, the bed in the
room is <i>not</i> large enough to sleep two).</p>

<p><b>What is the deadline to book a room?</b></p>

<p>Room availability and the $40 rate are guaranteed only up to May
28.  Some rooms <i>might</i> still be available after the deadline, but the
price may be slightly higher.  So book the room now!</p>

<p><b>How do I book a room?</b></p>

<p>Call 514-398-6367 between 9AM and 5PM EDT, from Monday to Friday,
and tell them you want to book a room for YAPC (the number
514-398-5200 will also work, starting around May 7).  Have a Visa
or Master Card number and expiration date on hand.  Note that the card
will be debited only when you actually use the room.</p>

<p><b>Can I pay by cheque or by cash?</b></p>


<p>McGill requires 30 days to clear a cheque, so you're better off
paying with a credit card (see previous question).  Unfortunately,
they cannot take cash payment.</p>


<p><b>Can I include payment for the room with my conference registration fee?</b></p>

<p>Nope, sorry.  The two are handled by different people.</p>

<p><b>For which dates can I book a room?</b></p>

<p>If you wish to book a room for earlier than the start of the
conference, or spend a few days in Montreal after the conference ends,
McGill can accommodate you. Call as soon as possible to ensure
availability.</p>

<p><b>Where/when do I show up to get my room?</b></p>

<p>Show up at <a
href=http://garuda.wcg.mcgill.ca/maps/action.lasso?-Database=A.Bdg&-Table=W&-Response=r.html&ID=134&-Search>
Bishop Mountain Hall</a> between 7AM and 10PM on the day for which
you booked the room.</p>

<p><b>What facilities do the rooms offer?</b></p>

<p>McGill has only single rooms, which are not air-conditioned.
Internet access is available to guests in the hall at the centre of
the residence complex, although wireless ethernet is not. Linens,
towels and soap are provided for shared bathing facilities. A shared
kitchen is accessible.</p>

<p><b>If I cancel my YAPC registration, does my room get automatically
cancelled?</b></p>

<p>No.  You will have to call McGill to cancel your dorm room
reservation separately.</p>

<p><b>How do I cancel a reservation that has already been made?</b></p>

<p>Call the same number you did when booking the room, and tell them
you're cancelling.  If you cancel less than 30 days before the date
you booked for, you will be charged for a single day.  If you cancel
more than 30 days before the booking, it will cost you nothing.</p>


<p><b>Do you offer group discounts?</b></p>

<p>The $40 rate is already a kind of group discount, the group being
the YAPC attendees.  It was the best we could get.</p>
