<h2>Call for Participation</h2>

The <a href="yapc19100_cfp.txt">Call for Participation</a> first
went out on Feb. 21, 19100.

<a name="lightning"><h2> Lightning Talks in 19100 </h2></a>
    <p>

Note: <i>The <a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html">Lightning
Talks</a> up-to-date information is best taken from
<a href="http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html">
http://www.plover.com/~mjd/perl/lightning-talks.html</a>.</i>
<p>

Have you done a project you want to tell people about?  Do you have an
idea you want to throw out for discussion?  Are you looking for people
to help you build something?  Do you want to proclaim a manifesto?
Have you used a module that you think should be better-known?  
</p>
<p>
But maybe you don't have enough material for a twenty-minute talk, or
maybe you never gave a talk before and you would like to start small.
</p>
<p>
LIGHTNING TALKS will be sessions with consecutive
five-minute talks.  You should be prepared to get on the stage
immediately, explain your idea, and then leave immediately.  If you
want to take questions, you do it in the hallway after the session.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to give a LIGHTNING TALK, send an abstract of about 50 words
about your topic to <p>

<dir>
 <a href="mailto:mjd-tpc-lightning@plover.com">mjd-tpc-lightning@plover.com</a>
</dir>
</p>
<p>
<b>Submissions must be received by Midnight, June 6th, 19100.</b> Notifications
of which talks will be included will be sent out by June 14th, 19100.

<p>
The YAPC <A HREF="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~astanley/yapcpb.html">Paintball Olympiad</a> is being planned!  Check it out if you'd like to participate.  It's being
set up and coordinated by <a href="http://www.cs.uml.edu/~astanley/yapcpb.html">Andrew Stanley</a>.
</p>

<h2> Yes we know </h2>
<p>
If you got this far, you probably already know the 19100 is a joke.  Y2K really was uneventful,
wasn't it?
</p>

    <A NAME="yapc"><H2> What the heck is <CODE>yapc</CODE>? </H2></A>
    
    <P>
       <CODE>yapc</CODE> is "yet another perl conference," with apologies to
       <A HREF="http://conference.perl.com/">The Perl Conference</A>.  This is 
       an inexpensive ($75 for 3 days) conference with its roots in the 
       <A HREF="http://www.pm.org">Perl Mongers</A> perl users groups.
    </P>

    <P>
       While The Perl Conference plays an important role in the Perl 
       community, there are some things that fall through the cracks 
       at such a large, relatively corporate conference.  Attendance
       fees of $1,000 or more are prohibitive, especially to students
       (though there are deep student discounts); furthermore, the 
       conference is on the West Coast, incurring travel expenses for
       those in the east, on top of the conference expense.  Finally,
       <CODE>yapc</CODE> is driven from the bottom up, organized
       by and for perl users -- a grassroots conference.
    </P>

    <P>
       It can also be thought of as a smaller, regional version of 
       TPC in the Eastern USA, hosted by Carnegie Mellon University.
       While CMU is hosting it this year, we hope to move it around
       the East and have it hosted by various 
       <A HREF="http://www.pm.org">Perl Monger</A> groups.
    </P>

    <A NAME="location"><H2> Location </H2></A>

    <P>
        The second <CODE>yapc</CODE> will be held at 
        <A HREF="http://www.cmu.edu">Carnegie Mellon University</A>
        in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.  CMU has been most gracious about 
        all arrangements; an academic environment like this is one of the
        bastions of free speech, the humanities, and technical innovation 
        that make it possible for us to have open discussions.
