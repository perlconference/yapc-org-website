<p>MuniAuction is a three-year-old Pittsburgh-based Internet start-up that
hosts auctions of fixed-income financial instruments such as municipal
bonds, discount notes, and certificates of deposit (i.e. CD's). As of June
2000, MuniAuction programmers have written 90,000 lines of Perl. Prior
to launching a new "secondary market auction" product which management
believed would generate a tenfold or more increase of users over previous
auctions, MuniAuction software engineers investigated and rejected several
commercial webserver loadtesting products before deciding to write their
own Perl based loadtester.&nbsp; The custom-built loadtester has been a
great success; MuniAuction is now able to very precisely benchmark and
measure changes in system performance, to estimate system loading based
upon various bidding scenarios, and to replay auctions from start to finish
to validate software.
