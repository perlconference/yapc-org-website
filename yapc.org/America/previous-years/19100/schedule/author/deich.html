to Testing Quality of Care Software.</h2>

<p>Hundreds of managed care organizations (MCOs) generate yearly reports
on standardized quality of care measures.&nbsp; These measures are specified
by and audited under the supervision of the National Committee for Quality
Assurance (NCQA).&nbsp;&nbsp; Auditing the measures has included reading
the code used to process data.&nbsp; Acumetrics developed a software-testing
tool that is being adopted by NCQA as a more rigorous way to audit software
used to report such measures. We used Perl as the underlying support for
a language appropriate for formalizing the NCQA measures and to generate
test files and scoring protocols.&nbsp; This language is based on a control-flow
approach (Beizer, 1995).
<p>The statement:
<p><font face="Courier New,Courier">path[member.enroll &lt; &amp;last(member.enroll
+ 45)] : do &amp;makerec(enroll) --> node 20;</font>
<p>will instantiate the current enrollment to a date that meets the criterion
of being less than 45 days after the previous enrollment, and make a simulated
database record. The language (SAL) aided in two ways:&nbsp; First, most
of our coding for the NCQA measures themselves has been done by programmers
with much NCQA quality measure auditing experience, but limited programming
experience.&nbsp; Second, the rigorous examination of the NCQA standards
has
<br>lead NCQA to further enhance&nbsp; the specifications for the majority
of the measures.
<p>Perl's features made it a fine development language for SAL.&nbsp; Regular
expressions speed the development of a parser for SAL.&nbsp; Support for
references and complex structures was essential.&nbsp; Perl does searches
within complex networks to generate a varied set of individual test cases,
and varies these cases further by choosing different values for fields
along the same path.&nbsp; Perl's 'eval' function was also essential.&nbsp;&nbsp;
Here we review the SAL language as applied in this testing situation, and
report on the structure of the Perl parsing and test case generating system.
