Church and State</h2>

<h3>
Dick Hardt</h3>
ActiveState Tool Corp.
<p><i>Thursday, 3:30 in McConomy.</i>
<p>With the line becoming increasingly blurred between the Community and
business as more companies become involved in the OSS space and valuations
skyrocket, how do we ensure that the merits of Open Source and its ideals
are not co-opted by corporations while still allowing for commercial enterprises'
benefits?
<p>Similar to a church, the Community provides the values for software
creation and evolution based on an open development model that belongs
to users with everyone contributing.&nbsp; A state, provides security to
its people, akin to companies providing the quality assurance, packaging
and services that many of its users desire.&nbsp; The two supply very different
and yet complimentary functions.&nbsp; The Community ensures wide choice
and flexibility, giving developers the opportunity to selectively tune
and modify software to specifically suit their goals.&nbsp; The corporation
provides the stability and ease of use for applying the software to real
world business solutions.
<p>A merging of those two groups would undermine the very elements that
allow them to successfully flourish.&nbsp; Thus the separation of church
and state is essential for OSS to retain the components that give it the
edge over proprietary software -- its freely available and constantly evolving.&nbsp;
This will allow OSS as it matures to remain THE software backbone of the
Internet.
