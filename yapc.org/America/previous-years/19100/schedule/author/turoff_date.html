Date Handling with Perl</h2>

<h3>
Adam Turoff</h3>
<i>Friday, 11 AM in Rangos I.</i>
<p>This talk will discuss date handling issues using localtime(), gmtime(),
etc.&nbsp; Basic date calculations will be discussed, such as determining
when yesterday was regardless of any daylight savings time rollovers, first
monday of the month/year, etc.
<p>Perl Modules like Date::Manip and Date::Calc will be discussed and compared
to each other.&nbsp; Yet another date module (which will most likely be
called Calendar::Civil or Calendar::Standard) will be discussed, which
will deal with specific calendaring issues, such as calculating easter,
solstices, and week number.&nbsp; Conversions to other calendars, such
as the ISO calendar, French Revolutionary Calendar and possibly the Hebrew
calendar will be discussed.
<p>In order to keep this talk interesting to a general audience, algorithms
to calculate these phenomena will be alluded tu but not described in any
great detail.&nbsp; Simple date math based on interval counting will also
be discussed, but not in any great detail.&nbsp; Conversions to swatch
internet time will also be mentioned briefly.
