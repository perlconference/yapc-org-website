Perl Quizzo</h2>

<h3>
Adam Turoff</h3>
<i>At a meal.</i>
<br>&nbsp;
<p>The Philadelphia Perl Mongers have a tradition of adjourning to a local
pub after our technical meetings for dinner and a pub quiz called Quizzo.
The quiz that Perl Quizzo is modeled after consists of 4 rounds of 10 general
trivia questions.&nbsp; The winning team at the end of the night wins a
$50 gift certificate, and the 2nd place team wins a case of Guinness.&nbsp;
Usually ten or more teams participate on any given night.&nbsp; In the
event of a first place tie, a tiebreaker round is used to decide the winner.&nbsp;
Each team can designate one of the four rounds to be their joker round,
whereby their score is doubled; this joker can only be played once.
<p>The proposed format for Perl Quizzo is a modification of this general
trivia game.&nbsp; The intent is to involve the entire conference instead
of a small group of contestants.&nbsp; Each team should be composed of
no more than 8-10 teammates, with a secret intent of forging community
among people who haven't met yet.&nbsp; Teammates are encouraged to discuss
answers among themselves and discouraged from communicating with other
teams.&nbsp; There is no stated policy on the use of electronic devices
(palm pilots, cell phones, laptops, cell modems, etc.); if you've got it,
use it.&nbsp; :-)
<p>Ten questions will be asked in each of three rounds.&nbsp; Each team
first chose a (unique) name and will submit their answers on paper to the
judges at the end of each round.&nbsp; After the judges have received all
answers, the submissions will be scored as the answers are read out to
the teams.&nbsp; The scores will be announced prior to the start of the
next round (or announcement of the winners).
<p>To be fair, each round will consist of 10 questions, one question in
each of ten categories.&nbsp; These categories will range from general
knowledge of Perl, guru-level Perl, general Geek trivia and Pop culture.
Possible categories include:
<ul>
<li>
Free Software</li>

<li>
Free Speech</li>

<li>
Free Beer</li>

<li>
Special Variables</li>

<li>
Name the Module</li>

<li>
i18n (catch-all for international topics)</li>

<li>
Science Fiction</li>

<li>
Name the company (given a description and a ticker symbol)</li>

<li>
mdb (catchall for movie related topics)</li>

<li>
mp3 (catchall for music related topics)</li>
</ul>
etc.
<p>Selection of these categories is intended to keep the interest of both
hardcore Perl hackers and journeyman Perl users.&nbsp; Each round should
take 10-15 minutes.
