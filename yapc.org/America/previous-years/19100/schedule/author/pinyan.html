<h2>
Data Structures: Perl vs Python Ordered Hashes</h2>

<h3>
Jeff Pinyan</h3>
DALnet/EFNet #perl
<p><i>Thursday, 12:00 Noon in Rangos II.</i>
<p>How does one create an ordered hash?&nbsp; What is the thought process
involved, and what data structures are needed inside this ordered hash
object?
<p>In this talk, we'll analyze two modules, one in Perl, OrderedHash.pm,
and one in Python, OrderedDict.py, and see how to implement an ordered
associative array (for a nice general term) structure.&nbsp; Python is
more object-oriented by default, so an OrderedDict object appears to be
just like an array or a dictionary.&nbsp; In OrderedHash.pm, I keep an
OO approach (for a tying interface, look at GS's Tie::IxHash), and so it
is more apparent that there is magic going on underneath.
<p>As an added bonus, we'll look at a module that binds an array and a
hash for a read-only approach to ordered hashes, ArrayHash.pm.&nbsp; Unlike
MJD's ArrayHashMonster.pm, ArrayHash.pm is based on mucking around with
the symbol table so that it /appears/ that an array and a hash are really
the same thing.
