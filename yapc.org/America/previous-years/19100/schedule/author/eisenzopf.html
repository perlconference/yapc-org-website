<h2>
XML&nbsp;for the Masses</h2>

<h3>

<p>By now, XML fever has bubbled up through many IT organizations and seeped
into most developer publications. Unfortunately, many people who&nbsp;
use and develop the Web have been left behind scratching their heads, wondering
when XML will become an easy and practical alternative to HTML. This presentation
will cover new XML developments in the Perl community&nbsp; and offer several
case studies that demonstrate the usefulness of XML.
<p>Supporting the various Web browsers with varying degrees of support
for HTML, Javascript, and CSS is extremely difficult at best. The recent
addition of mobile devices like phones and Palm Pilots combined with the
growing number of Internet devices will make it impossible to optimize
a Web site for all clients. In the first study, XML will&nbsp; be utilized
as a single source format for Web documents. The Web server will dynamically
deliver the requested document in the proper format based on the type of
browser or device that makes the request.
<br>&nbsp;
<br>One of the difficulties Web sites will have is the transition from
HTML to XML. The World Wide Web Consortium has proposed a transitional
format called XHTML, which will make it easier to convert to XML. The second
case study will demonstrate the HTML to XML conversion process and explore
the benefits of extending XHTML to include additional information.
<p>As businesses move to the Web, sites are creating partnerships that
might include the exchange of products, marketing, or content. These partnerships
require an effective system that can perform queries and transactions between
disparate systems. The third study will explore the use of XML-RPC as a
method of passing information
<br>between applications.
