     ** Abstract submission deadline:  April  3, 2000 **

Yet Another Perl Conference (YAPC) is an inexpensive ($75) perl 
users and developers conference, with a mix of tutorials and 
technical talks.  The conference is set in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
and so is relatively accessible from both the East and the Midwest.

YAPC began as a grassroots users conference, from discussions 
among Perl Mongers, and has grown from there.  We would like
to invite you to join us for two days of Perl, people, and 
demonstrations, at a price that shouldn't hurt your wallet.  
There will be a limit of just under 500 people for the conference.

A number of members of the Perl community are contributing to this
event, including:

   Larry Wall, Abigail, Damian Conway, Mark-Jason Dominus, 
   Joseph Hall, purl, Randal Schwartz, ...

    ... and YOU!  See the CALL FOR PAPERS below!

Look to the main web page for more details --

** Dorm rooms **

A limited number of inexpensive dorm rooms are available at 
Carnegie Mellon, that will be given preferentially to students, 
but more generally on a first-come basis.  This is to further
reduce the cost for those with limited resources, especially 
students, who we are trying to encourage the most.  More 
information will become available when registration begins.
