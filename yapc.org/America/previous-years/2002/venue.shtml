Getting from Lambert to      Washington U. is an inexpensive cab ride or a $1.25 <A HREF="http://www.bi-state.org/lightmp.htm">light rail ride</A> with a short walk from the Delmar station.</p>      <p><b>By train:</b> St. Louis is served by <A HREF="http://www.amtrak.com/">Amtrak</A> which arrives and departs several times daily at the <A HREF="http://www.stltoday.com/stltoday/news/columns.nsf/Greg%20Freeman/B5D21710E923814686256AF5004D07A3/story?opendocument">AmShack</A>.

Since it's summertime, driving late at night to avoid construction and traffic is highly recommended. Those driving in from the East on I-70/64 should pay attention when approaching the Poplar Street Bridge over the Mississippi since it's a twisty maze of exit ramps that all look alike so read the signs and stay in the furthest to the left lane all the way across the river. Those staying in the dorms will need to take the <A HREF="http://www.slu.edu/pr/directions.html">Grand Avenue Exit</A>. Cheshire Inn people should keep driving until they see the Standard Oil sign looming above the horizon, get all the way over to the right and take the Clayton Road exit: straight ahead will be the Cheshire Inn to the left after the light, to the right and down Skinker will be Washington University.</P>      <p><b>By bus:</b><A HREF="http://www.greyhound.com/">Greyhound Bus</A> does service St. Louis and is a short cab ride to Washington University.
