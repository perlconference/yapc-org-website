                 the Fourth North American<br>

      <p>  <b><a href="http://yapc.org/America/">http://yapc.org/America/</a></b>

      <p>            Washington University,<br>
                      Saint Louis, Missouri

      </div>

<p>YAPC is a place for people to meet and talk about Perl -- where
people who've done interesting things, people who are working
on the language itself, people who are using it daily,
and people who are looking to learn about it are all within
arm's reach.  Some of the great authors and coders in the field
will be on hand to discuss their work, as well as the nature
and direction of Perl itself.

<p>Please join us for three days of listening and talking about 
Perl in Saint Louis.

   <p>Please submit your abstracts to &lt;<a
   href="mailto:na-author@yapc.org">na-author@yapc.org</a>&gt;. See Lightning
   Talk submission instructions below.  For all other talks, authors
   are requested to limit their abstracts to 300 words. 
   <br><br>

  <li>This year we will accept a number of types of talks:
   <br><br>
   <ul>
     <li><b>Lightning:</b> <i>5 minutes</i>

       <p>The lightning talks were instigated by Mark-Jason Dominus
       two years ago in Pittsburgh, and were replicated with great 
       success at the European YAPC in London.

       <p>Participants speak for no more than five minutes, with the use
       of conventional transparencies.  Any use of data projector,
       etc, is discouraged, but allowed as long as the five minute
       time limit is maintained (set-up will be done as the clock
       ticks).  The talk ends at the five-minute mark, regardless of
       whether the speaker has finished.

       <p>Any topic is allowed, and some have been fantastically 
       humourous.  Lightning talks are an excellent forum for 
       first-time speakers.

       <p>Please send your talk title, and an abstract of one to four
    sentences, to:
 
      <p><div align="center">
      <b><a href="mailto:mjd-yapc-lt-2002+@plover.com">mjd-yapc-lt-2002+@plover.com</a></b>
      </div>

       <p>The deadline for submissions is the end of Wednesday, June 5, 2002.
        Submitters will be notified of acceptance by Sunday, June 15.
        For more details, visit:

        </div>

       <br><br>

     <li><b>Standard:</b> <i>20 minutes</i>

       <p>A standard talk is the preferred format.  This is enough 
       time to start a topic, introduce it with some pithy slides, 
       and open up to later conversation. 
       <br><br>

     <li><b>Long and Extra-Long:</b> <i>45 minutes, 90 minutes</i>

       <p>Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering
       large topics.  If you have an in-depth topic you would like
       to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable 
       discussion, a Long or Extra-Long talk may be the format of 
       choice.
       <br><br>

     <li><b>Tutorial:</b>  <i>3 hours + break (possibly in two sets)</i>

       <p>Half-day (or possibly full-day) tutorials.
     </ul>
   </ul>
