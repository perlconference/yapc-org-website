      <H3>What is YAPC?</H3>

      <p>YAPC is "yet another Perl conference", with apologies to 
      <img src="images/yapcbg.jpg" alt="YAPC logo" width=114 height=125 align="right">
      <a href="http://conference.perl.com/">The Perl Conference</a>.
      This is an inexpensive (US$ 85 for 3 days) conference with its roots in the 
      <a href="http://www.pm.org/">Perl Mongers</a> Perl users groups.

      <p>While The Perl Conference plays an important role in the Perl community, there
      are some things that fall through the cracks at such a large, relatively 
      corporate conference. Attendance fees of $1,000 or more are prohibitive,
      especially to students (though there are deep student discounts); furthermore,
      the conference is on the West Coast, incurring travel expenses for those in the
      east, on top of the conference expense. YAPC is driven from the bottom
      up, organized by and for Perl users -- a grassroots conference.

      <p>YAPC began as a smaller, regional version of <a href="http://conferences.oreillynet.com/">TPC</a> in the Eastern USA, hosted 
      by <a href="http://www.cmu.edu/">Carnegie Mellon University</a>, and has become
      a <a href="http://www.yapc.org/">series of conferences</a> held in multiple
      areas of the globe, all aimed at bringing together the Perl community in an
      accessible manner. 
      
      <p>
      This year, YAPC will be held at
      <a href="http://www.fau.edu/">Florida Atlantic University</a> in Boca Raton, Florida, USA,
      hosted by the <a href="http://southflorida.pm.org/">South Florida Perl Mongers</a>.
