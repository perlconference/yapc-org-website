In this presentation, we'll cover a variety of advanced Mason techniques,                                             
focusing on code re-use, performance, and custom behavior.  Specific                                                  
topics to be covered include going beyond typical autohandler and dhandler                                            
usage to create complex dispatch systems, using component attributes and                                              
methods, component calls with content, subrequest, caching, obscure                                                   
configuration parameters, and subclassing Mason for ultimate flexibility.                                             
                                                                                                                      
This presentation will include discussion of Mason in a web environment,                                              
as well as using Mason for things like configuration management and                                                   
creating flexible development environments.
