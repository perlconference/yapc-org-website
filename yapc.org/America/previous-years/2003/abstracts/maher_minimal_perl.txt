                                 ABSTRACT                                                                             
                                                                                                                      
Most Perl training is designed to have the maximum appeal to the                                                      
broadest audience, which leads to Windows and UNIX programmers                                                        
learning from the same OS-agnostic curriculum.                                                                        
                                                                                                                      
In contrast, this tutorial capitalizes on the existing UNIX and                                                       
POSIX-shell knowledge of its attendees, rather than ignoring it.                                                      
This approach helps them to write effective Perl more rapidly,                                                        
with fewer blunders, and with greater satisfaction.                                                                   
                                                                                                                      
The first part is geared to "Shell Users", and features simple Perl                                                   
commands that offer improvements over sed, grep, sort, and awk.                                                       
The second part is dedicated to "Shell Programmers", and emphasizes                                                   
similarities and differences between language features.  For example,                                                 
attendees will not only learn how to emulate the shell's "while" loop     
in Perl, but also why Perl's "do/while" is not as cool as it seems.
