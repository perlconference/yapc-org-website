Authentication with LDAP - mod_perl and Apache                                                                        
                                                                                                                      
If LDAP host authentication is in place in an organization, it can be                                                 
useful to extend this authentication to your mod_perl based                                                           
applications and Apache's basic authentication.  Apache::AuthenLDAP                                                   
can be leveraged to handle basic authentication for Apache.  This talk                                                
will consider a mod_per module developed to replace the functionality                                                 
of our in-house mod_nis module.  This allows user authentication via                                                  
unix usernames and passwords while limiting access to applications                                                    
based on unix groups.  However, unlike mod_nis it is not limited to                                                   
unix groups for application access.
