1) Introduction to Mail::Box                                                                                          
                                                                                                                      
   This talk can be anything between 45 minutes and 4 days: there is                                                  
   so much to tell about Mail::Box.  I prefer to present a 3 hrs tutorial,                                            
   in which case it will be an updated version of the tutorial of last
