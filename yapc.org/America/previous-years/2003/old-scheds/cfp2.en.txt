*** Third North American YAPC: Second Call for Participation ***

                    Yet Another Society
              calls for your participation in

                         YAPC 2001
                 the Third North American 
               Yet Another Perl Conference

                 http://yapc.org/America/

                     McGill University,
                      Montreal, Quebec 

                  Wednesday through Friday 
                      June 13-15, 2001

YAPC is a place for people to meet and talk about Perl -- where
people who've done interesting things, people who are working
on the language itself, people who are using it daily,
and people who are looking to learn about it are all within
arm's reach.  Some of the great authors and coders in the field
will be on hand to discuss their work, as well as the nature
and direction of Perl itself.

Please join us for three days of listening and talking about 
Perl in Montreal.  

** Conference registration is NOW OPEN! 

           http://na-register.yapc.org

   Conference Registration Cost: USD$85 (about CAD$125)

** Dorm rooms will be available in Montreal; specific arrangements are
   still being made with McGill, but we expect dorm accommodations
   to cost under USD$25 per night for a single room.

** YAPC is looking for sponsors. Please Contact Kevin Lenzo
   (lenzo@yapc.org) for information about how you can help support the
   Yet Another Society and YAPC.  Much of the necessary funding for
   YAPC comes from the generous donations of our sponsors.

** Submitted papers:             Submission Deadline: May 1, 2001

   All topics are welcome.  Here is a short list of subjects that 
   might be presented: 

     XML, CGI/Web, Interprocess Communication, GUIs (GTk, Tk), 
     Natural Language Processing, Interactive Perl,  Agents,
     Perl as Glue, Object-Oriented Perl, Scientific Applications,
     Guts, Internals, JAPHs, Perl Poetry, System Administration,
     DBI/DBD, Non-UNIX Perl, Security, Peer-to-Peer Communication,
     Your Favorite Topic.

   Please submit your abstracts to <na-author@yapc.org>. Authors are
   requested to limit their abstracts to four sentences for
   Lightning Talks, and to 300 words for other talks.

   This year we will accept a number of types of talks:

     * Lightning:  5 minutes

       The lightning talks were instigated by Mark-Jason Dominus
       last year in Pittsburgh, and were replicated with great 
       success at the European YAPC in London.
       
       Participants speak for exactly five minutes, with the use
       of conventional overheads.  Any use of data projector, etc,
       is discouraged, but allowed as long as the five minute time
       limit is maintained (set-up will be done as the clock ticks).

       Any topic is allowed, and some have been fantastically
       humourous.  Lightning talks are an excellent forum for
       first-time speakers.

       To propose a lightning talk, please send an abstract of no more
       than four sentences to:

               mjd-yapc-lightning+@plover.com 

       by the end of May 31, 2001. If your talk is selected for
       presentation, you will be notified by June 6. For more complete
       information about Lightning Talks, please visit

               http://perl.plover.com/lightning-talks.html 

     * Standard:      20 minutes

       A standard talk is the preferred format.  This is enough 
       time to start a topic, introduce it with some pithy slides, 
       and open up to later conversation. 

     * Long and Extra-Long:   45 minutes, 90 minutes

       Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering
       large topics.  If you have an in-depth topic you would like
       to present in some detail, perhaps with considerable 
       discussion, a Long or Extra-Long talk may be the format of 
       choice.

     * Tutorial:   3 hours + 30 break (possibly in two sets)

       Half-day (or possibly full-day) tutorials.

  Please submit your abstracts to <na-author@yapc.org>! 

Thank you; we hope you will participate. If you have any questions,
please mail <na-help@yapc.org>.
