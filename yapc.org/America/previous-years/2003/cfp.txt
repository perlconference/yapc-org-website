                         Yet Another Society
                  calls for your participation in

                              YAPC 2002
                      the Fourth North American
                    Yet Another Perl Conference

                      http://yapc.org/America/ 

                          Washington University,
                          Saint Louis, Missouri

                       Wednesday through Friday
                           June 26-28, 2002

YAPC is a place for people to meet and talk about Perl -- where people
who've done interesting things, people who are working on the language
itself, people who are using it daily, and people who are looking to
learn about it are all within arm's reach. Some of the great authors
and coders in the field will be on hand to discuss their work, as well
as the nature and direction of Perl itself.

Please join us for three days of listening and talking about Perl in
Saint Louis.

Please submit your abstracts to <na-author@yapc.org>. See Lightning
Talk submission instructions below.  For all other talks, authors
are requested to limit their abstracts to 300 words.

This year we will accept a number of types of talks: 

  * Lightning: 5 minutes 

    The lightning talks were instigated by Mark-Jason Dominus two
    years ago in Pittsburgh, and were replicated with great success
    at the European YAPC in London.

    Participants speak for no more than five minutes, with the use 
    of conventional transparencies. Any use of data projector, etc, 
    is discouraged, but allowed as long as the five minute time limit 
    is maintained (set-up will be done as the clock ticks). The talk 
    ends at the five-minute mark, regardless of whether or not the 
    speaker has finished.

    Any topic is allowed, and some have been fantastically humourous. 
    Lightning talks are an excellent forum for first-time speakers.

    Please send your talk title, and an abstract of one to four
    sentences, to:

    mjd-yapc-lt-2002+@plover.com

    The deadline for submissions is the end of Wednesday, June 5, 2002.
    Submitters will be notified of acceptance by Sunday, June 15.
    Visit http://perl.plover.com/lt/yapc2002.html for more details.

  * Standard: 20 minutes 

    A 'standard' talk is the preferred format. This is enough time 
    to start a topic, introduce it with some pithy slides, and open 
    up to later conversation.

  * Long and Extra-Long: 45 minutes, 90 minutes 

    Long talks are reserved for experienced speakers covering large
    topics. If you have an in-depth topic you would like to present 
    in some detail, perhaps with considerable discussion, a Long or
    Extra-Long talk may be the format of choice.

  * Tutorial: 3 hours + break (possibly in two sets) 

    Half-day (or possibly full-day) tutorials. 

Please submit your abstracts to <na-author@yapc.org>!
